A ball in Peter's capital,
Abandoning insane delight,
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.(82)
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A case of books he doth obtain--
"Abandon hope for ever here!"
A charm with it in conversation.
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A breathless silence then, prolonged--
Above the yawning grave would fight,--
A canine face with horns thereon,
A coquette loves by calculation,
Address to you one single phrase
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
A box of terrible import.
Accents of rapture or despair
A constant harping on one tune,
A crab upon a spider rides,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A door he opens. But why shrank
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
A ball here, there a children's treat,
Abandon cities riotous,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A bastard fame prohibited?
About the rain and flax and cattle."--
A bearded postillion astride
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
About the crop of hay, the wine,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
Above the humble urn of death.
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A careless looker-on estranged
Above the ashes of the dead.
Accelerates her hasty pace,
A critic of the stage malicious,
A country damsel's album trim,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the smiling face of dawn.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Adieu she to the matron said
Adorned with many a vision bright
A child devoid of childishness
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
A duellist of classic mind,
A due which must to earth be paid.
A double force unto their song
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
"Advance!"--
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
A dying man with art to soothe,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
_Affectionately yours till death_.
A faithful model she appeared
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A friar black approaching near,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
After the wedded couple strain;
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A fond and careful mother been.
Again her rural life she sought,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Against my inclination, friends,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
A first success light pinions gave,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
Age immature averse to cheat--
A game of chess would often play,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
A happy destiny ordained:
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
A hand of ice appeared to seize
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A garden by a shining rill.
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
Ah! he has gone the other way"--
A lady draws the hostess near,
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
A bottle of a vintage white
Affection how did you requite?
A flimsy trace of musings past
Again a century should scourge
Again imagination blazed,
Again the plague of boyhood--love?
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
A gust of passion never tore
A hidden train of wild desire.
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
A jolly song and distant horn;
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
A joyous troop of little boys
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Albums magnificent which scare
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All that industrial London brings
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Also my wretched liberty
All that the heart would fain express--
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
And after Albion's proud lyre
Abandoned he his country seat,
All this in many cases brings
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Almost became a poet say--
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Along the hall, and high above
All which in Paris eager taste,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already he grew phthisical.
Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
Alone within his habitation
Although it will not bear translation,
A mansion--by the window, see!
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Amidst successes flattering
A mien unaltered she preserved,
And a malicious epigram
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great;
And aimless journeys did commence--
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
And all thy precious elegies,
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verse--
And an encouragement did breathe
And beckon to the passing sails.
And better, if I judge aright;
And blest me, sinking to the grave.(78)
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
And buried deep in meditation,
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And due precautions take betimes.
And every morning I awake
And fields my joys have ever been;
And following them ye might espy
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
And both of dull existence tired,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by degrees upon him grew
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And devastate the woods around.
And clad in airy costume took
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
And ease and fashionable waste,--
And finally he deigns let fall
And far removed from rumour vain;
And fled afar--she followed me.
And for a time our course delay,
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
And from his dressing-room would pass
And (elbows on the table) they
And from the country all around
And in society might shed
And from the Millionaya afar
"And is it long since back he came?
And now we hear delightedly
And impiously should declare,
And solitude and calm delight.
And sermon--but in that dread hour
And such unconsciously he led,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And wholly occupied his day--
An honourable course ye took,
A notoriety proclaimed,
A vision desolate and drear
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
And, inspiration firing me,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But now--my very blood congeals,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But say he was a genius who
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But this is my advice, 'twere best
Both natural and truthful seemed.
But upon all that Eugene knew
But with austerity!--for you
A certain little escapade
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And grant success to labour long;
And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
And hastened to his uncle's side,
And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed_!--
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I confess that now-a-days
And gallops to her house away.
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in reality one day
And happy unto you appear.
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
"And is it," meditates Eugene.
"And is it she? It must be--no--
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And isolated from all men,
And it may be a secret dread
And irrigate them with champagne;
And jests doth recapitulate.
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like a shadow haunted her.
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
And many a caravan on high
And like the prisoner's our delight
And may fall headlong any time.
And more imagination teems.
And meditative homeward goes,
And naked uniformity.
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now upon the snow in thaw
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
And soon Oneguine's door beside
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
And supercilious dames she glides,
And she at last hath us deceived;
And the extent of his caprice;
And the world met her smilingly,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And on the last one, underlined:
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And soon imagination threw
And still the coachmen round the fires
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the young revellers of past times
And though her soul might be confused,
And though perchance a lady may
And they the waters recommend.
And through the lofty windows views
And the conviction soon arose,
And thus he never fell among
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus in season the rich field
And thy inebriating wave
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
And vehemently though amazed
And visit many a foreign clime,
And unto whom we all allude
And vows will probably be signed:
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And wished to say to him farewell.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
And with his lot in life content,
And wild among them grew her words--
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
Applause, the people's donative.
A pensive sorrow in her glance
A table to the fire is brought,
At fifty who relief obtained
Arrange without the least delay--
A register of fleeting thought,
At morn an icy bath within
And where a madrigal occurs
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Are oft deceptive--like their feet.
Are ye replaced by other maids
As in a garden when I grew,
An innate love of meditation,
A slave of actresses capricious,
As one who bivouacs afield,
A passionate desire to bend
A Russian poem's mechanism
As storms which in chill autumn rage
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
As to a worthy man and good!
A tender couplet he combined,
At first, but soon became inured
At morn I must assuredly
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
And o'er the granite coping bent,
And necessary fools allowed.
And platitudes and pedantry,
And shorter had the days become.
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
And that too often we receive
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the heart's agitated dreams.
And then made merry pope and guest,
And now she skips and now she springs
And the suspicious veteran old,
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And what the old man might bequeath.
Another tribune of the ball
Are admirable, my dear friend,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
And with gray hair ambrosial
As men who much had done that day.
As many entertainments be!
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
At table she was sitting by
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And wild festivities among
As on the rapid wings of thought
Assemblies oligarchical
At thirty who was married well,
As your light footprints on the green.
At this time almost understood.
At times three words to him addressed
A very troublesome disease,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
A visionary mortified,
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awakens secret merriment
Away! and cease to ring their praise
A pair; though desolate my mind,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A wish from place to place to roam,
And yet the city's flower was there,
Aye bids ye in some way or other--
A young Armida's lips to press,
Awhile sound conversation seems
A young man motionless he saw,
Because a member I became.
And never was the ear affright
Before him her wild game of chance.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Because he could not gourmandise
Behind her a grave general.
Behold the dames who once were fine
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Beside the stormy sea one day
Better than Chateaubriand did
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Between myself and my Eugene,
But my Oneguine the whole eve
"Bring dinner now without delay!"
But stop! I will present thee, if
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Both day and night he now must pass
Buried in meditation deep,
But at a later, sterile age,
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
But Eugene, hating litigation
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But gazes on Oneguine's face
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But now ridiculous a bit.
But on the third of grove and mead
But still remembrance to him clings,
But such is not my project now,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
But I abandoned their array,
But round the hostess scintillate
But suddenly all changed around!
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But better loved the soft repose
But, O ye tomes without compare,
But the indifferent princess,
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
But the young unpolluted heart
But turning morning into night,
But turn we once more to our dame.
Before whom once in solitude,
But thoughts meander far away--
But was our friend Eugene content,
But were it not immoral I
But could not. Then she questioned him:--
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
A weary season was at hand--
Before you agonized to die--
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
But Eugene long hath left the press
But sad is the reflection made,
But, that life longer may remain,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
But finally she softly said:
But memory like a serpent's tooth
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But what results? His eyes peruse
But who in that choice company
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But would not look at Cicero.
But with confused and bashful air,
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
By friendship how they were abused,
By fond illusions once possest
By his embarrassed dignity--
By love's inevitable flame.
By liberties or loose or light.
By many a lamp illuminate,
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
But such is not for me. I brood
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
By the fine silver of the north.
By waters shining tranquilly,
Calm and without embarrassment,
Calmly her eyes encounter his--
Can she have been a moment gone
By visions who was ne'er deranged
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Careless of every social rule,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Calling to mind your icy look
Caught him and by the collar took
Charms more enduring in the end.
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
By recklessness amuse or shame
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
China and bronze the tables weight,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Cursing his own stupidity,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Choosing a profitable trade,
Conquer by passion and address,
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Deep in the distant province rude,
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Deliberate approach of guests
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Delighted glances in return;
Daily of love in solitude.
Delighted much his former ways
Depicted on your haughty face!
Descends the bank with care extreme,
But word for word his letter read.
Corneille's majestic genius,
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Despair and anger seize on me,
Desirous to annihilate
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Detecting him the passing horse
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Displayed a noble rectitude--
Develops and matures its powers,
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
Divinity without access
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
Describe in detail the affair,
Do agitate his late repose.
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Dreams with no continuity,
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Enraptured was he if allowed
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
"Drive on!" the cheerful cry goes forth,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Economy political,
Employ your glasses constantly,
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Epistle second, note the third,
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
Eternally to imitate
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Ennui can in the country dwell
E'en as the poet says he leant.
Enough! my pack is now unslung--
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
Eugene designed with me to start
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Faces which we meet everywhere
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Familiar to him long ago.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Follow up love--a secret meeting
For a fictitious misanthrope,
For a protracted space of time.
Faithfully shall I now depict,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
For law I _far niente_ take
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
For otherwise--God only knows!
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
For our amusement ever made
For promises her feet reveal
For rural solitude and dreams,
Fond declarations they invite
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
For tallow, wood and other things
Flies past the porter to the stair,
Existence would not make a curse,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Far from his Italy--his own.
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
For the young poet they display.
For empty sound the rascal swore he
For him were but of little worth,
For treachery had done its worst;
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
For which the poet agonized
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
For two whole days it seemed a change
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
A hidden meaning could impart,
Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
Ah! it may be, affection true
A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Akulka who was once Celine,
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alas! the friend of childish days
A lancer captivates her heart!
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A life of fact, not fiction, led--
A life in common with the rest;
"Aline!"
All about Olga--to a light
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"
A hundred times will not repeat,
A kerchief round her silver hair
Alike by sighs and flattery.
All are amazed; but Lenski he
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Alas! with merited reproach.
A letter for her hero meant:
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little farther please to read
A little virgin mirror peeps.
"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
All arise. To the door he goes.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become;
All in the good old style appears,
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All overtures of friendship ended.
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All this was novel to Eugene.
All sons of mental weariness.
All the creations which below
All that a poet could desire,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All this I know is out of date,
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course;
All with urbanity betray,
All the young people round about,
A loaded pistol in his hand.
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
All to the grand saloon are gone--
All this may be an empty dream,
Allure the young gallant
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone she gallops on her steed,
A lover's letter might convey,
A love which knew no limitation,
Already by repentance moved
Already dance to song proceeds;
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Already sings the nightingale.
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although we know that Eugene had
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
A maiden's secrets--of the heart.
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Always together, eventide
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
A mild quotation to translate,
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amid the awful emptiness
A modern Regulus unchained,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A moment effervescing stirs,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An almanac but eight years old.
An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
A million bipeds reckons thus
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And about dawn upon his breast
Amid the company career.
Although the destined coffin nears,
Also one Viazemski, remarking
A marriageable maid matured,
Am I to go through the whole list?"
An ancient lady full of grace.--
And a boy handed round the cream.
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And a determined disposition,
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again;
And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a half rubles down gave she;
And all that from thy hand proceeds--
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all with one accord agreed,
And a long time about her talked.
And a guitar produced we see,
And all the three to breakfast went;
And all your love on self bestow;
And alphabetically tries
And ancient usages observed
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all without her husband's leave.
And an elegiac poem wrote.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And a new diadem supplied.
And an old gent the poet marking
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And an habitual sense of pain;
And ease the tortures of the heart--
And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
All that perfection could desire;
And a romance in ancient style
And barely visible the smoke
And at the altar of their fame
And be as happy--as I might.
And be not in advance severe.
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And at the table sat her down.
And bitter torment never known.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And by a sweet delusion he
And by that shady rivulet
And, by the way, I here assert
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And can it be? But late a child
And female tears hysterical,
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And by the world repeated oft,
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And cares not farther to proceed;
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And disappear in space; then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And education runs to waste,
And enmity and hope and love--
And endless the cotillon seemed
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And exclamations and good cheer.
And eye which gleams with inspiration--
And fashionable magazines,
And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And form a network left and right;
And from the misty woodland nigh
And flooded all the level ground.
And full of innocent delight,
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And glittering simpletons beside;
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And hated casual visitors,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
And contemplative dreaminess;
And every year distributed
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And fashion's gay frivolities;
And freezing fits of weariness.
And gave himself but little pain
And heedless of approval seems,
And exclamations interlaced.
And gently hovered o'er my head?
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And glasses unemployed all night;
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And harmony was soon restored.
And hates the world's discordant ways.
"And he--but of him presently--
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And gallicisms I love as well
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And honestly 'tis my belief
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And I admired their common sense
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And her upon the threshold laid.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And husbands' tedious amity?
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
And in addition youth is flame
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And led me off to church with song."
And lonely through the forest creeps."
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And marking Tania's agitation,
And past the threshold of decay,
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And if Tattiana mine had found--
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she
And in her conversation drawled.
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And is it true her garland bright
And in the frosty night alone
And leads a solitary life?
And is it true and not a jest,
And Lenski followed--a light broke--
And many a day thereafter laid
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And many another slily sneered;
And long her eyes as through a haze
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And meditative from the spot
And now, I mournfully confess,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And life and fate in turn selected
And secretly their views expound.
And reads with rapid eager eye
And solitude and calm delight,
And she despite herself would waste
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And so--God bless them, if He list.
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And grown more curious by far
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
And irritates the appetite.
And judgment which unsteady veers
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
And is all light within destroyed?
And leans upon the monster's arm,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And in the morning doth not know
And linen on him doth bestow.
And like a palisade flit by.(72)
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And like Napoleons each of us
And lo! he is already there!
And long internal agitation
And long perukes hath vanished.
And love's delicious diadem
And loves you as--a relative!
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And now philanthropy his soul,
And make a dark existence shine
And of the attic. Honestly,
And no ridiculous report,
And our successors soon shall drive
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And my Tattiana now began
And oft in whispers would impart
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And others rise ephemeral!
And slowly life coagulates--
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And stupid censors passionate;
And mental elasticity.
And now his youthful heart desires
And since I pulled thee by the ear--
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And stay whose length none recollects.
And my dark soul to light was brought;
And my Eugene the path must trace--
And numerous pages had preserved
And privileges nice allowed,
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And that unrivalled paragon,
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And my romance's open theme
And our swift troikas never tire;
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And oft at eventide a throng
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
And the recesses of my mind
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
And the saloon threw open wide;
And the young damsel from the town,
And then the stanzas of my theme
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."
And these the attentive maid observed
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And this the faithful one allows,
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to Oneguine far away
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread--
And to these letters and these tears.
And usually despised it too),
And vanish like a bird in air.
And views amongst themselves advance
And the far mountains daintily
And the lime alley's twilight dim
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And triumphs in career erotic.
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And would by candlelight arise.
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
And what from its recess appears?
And who is not a tiresome thief?
An inn at every stage erect.
A noted fop who gambled hard.
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Another his betrothed was given;
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what will Destiny concede?"
And when her violence reviewed--
And where at last his bones repose
An ear to my confession lend;
Anicia soon appears, the door
Another could her heart engage,
An ever transcendental flight;
Another could her woe assuage
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And where may be her sister now?
And where the admirable streams
And who the rent-roll of his race
And where Thalia softly dreams
And with emotional delight
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And yet oblivion forbade.
A new proprietor arrived,
An exile from their troublous reign,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
Around the carriage of the pair--
Around the meadow and the grove.
As cyphers others to appraise,
And yet he in your cause would strive
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Another visit hastes to pay.
A new world was made manifest!
An invalid from lung complaint.
An hour passed by--another--till,
Another bard with art divine
An idle anchorite and sad,
Anticipating woe she pined,
An oval countenance and pink,
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Appear; along the road of Tver
A promenade in twilight late
An infant maiden doth exhort
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
A prudent man like you and brave
Arising with the morning's light,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Are not with elegance impressed.
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
Around my stanzas incomplete
As a babe's slumber, or the light
As a poetic life serene,
A Russian household simple quite,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
A scant attendance Lenski showed
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
A sense of social delight,
As formerly the shepherd sits
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And saying this Vladimir drained
And nothing more important sees;
And natural benevolence,
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And never hath our language proud
And ought he not to disregard
And overcome antipathies
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
And physic bring with mournful face,
And pelt him with cherries,
And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And on the footstool sitting down
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And scanned in silence its content.
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And showed with an uncertain light
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And silently I here must die--
And so departed. But Eugene,
And sulked in silent indignation;
And tears of reconciliation:
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And sometimes into snares as well
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And spouted it with lyric fire--
And supper. In the country we
And testy gamesters do engage
And starting suddenly doth say:
And that no longer could inspire.
And then with blind credulity
And the more surely we ensnare
And the Skatenines, aged pair,
And the sagacious Triquet back
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
And this fifth canto ought to be
And straight returning whence he came,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
And though I read it with distress,
And then to meditate for days
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy protection I implore.
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
And the young girl appeared before
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And what like menaces fatigues,
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And various chords upon it proves,
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
And to the field of honour led;
And turned aside the drapery;
And we--an unattractive set--
And well-instructed to betray!
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And you, O maids immaculate,
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
A new acquaintance we must scan.
An explanation: she was scared,
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Another! to none other I
Another with cock's head appeared,
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
A philosophic anchorite:
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Approach, approach; I am thine own."
Anew the flames of passion start
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
A pair of bullets--nought beside--
A paragon of virtue he!
Approach not to gaze at
Approach not to hearken
A print without the picture's grace,
And traces with a slender finger
As if impossible it were
A simple tombstone hath been set.
As in a thicket's humble shade,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
A smile from slumbering nature clear
A something somehow have obtained,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As in the timid forest deer,
As once, to fill the rapid page
As if with eider-down is filled.
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A substitute for lamps we hail!
As the reflection of his age,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As Saadi anciently averred--(86)
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
As with innumerable fires.(73)
At an old aunt's they had arrived
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
At early morn returns the maid
At first such contradictions wrought
Assistance ever will extend,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
At eventide would hither come,
At prisoner's base she never played.
Attentive listened to the lad.
A village and beneath, a wood,
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Basins and jugs--well! everything
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Before a fire which feebly glows
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Before the dregs they shall divine
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Beneath the silver of the moon
But, as he never opened them,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But even thus not now-a-days!
But finally grew bored by her.
Being from hell or heaven sent,
But grown familiar side by side
But more the passions occupy
But contrary to her advice
But from the interview what flowed?
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
Back to his regiment must roam.
But Lenski, having no desire
But nowhere can she find repose,
But now--none heeds the monument
But now our hero we must leave
But I the products of my Muse,
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But soon she altered all her ways,
Approaches Olga and the pair
A thick immense neglected grove
At his pale brow a shot to have,
At last became a ruined man.
A victim decked with golden leaves;
A visionary personage
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
A while ago the winter spent,
A white and undulating pall
A worthy object 'tis, and well
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
At neighbouring hospitalities.
Because he yawned at the bare view
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
Before he eighteen years attained.
But home his body to despatch
But now a question in this wise
But cannot stand the northern cold.
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you(70)
But I am now another's bride--
But lights incendiary flames
But nothing changed in them is seen,
But now in her effulgence pale
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
But Eugene, incontestably,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But Summer swiftly fades away
But since to the backdoor they led
But still more stupid did appear
But the date subsequently changed
But what a nuisance it will be,
But sweeter still it is to arrange
But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,
By flattery and lover's art--
By Providence's dark decree!
But Tania just as in a dream
By their own horses, not the post--
But with her elder sister I
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
But tell me what am I to do?
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But this a heinous crime appeared
But to Oneguine! _A propos_!
But ultimately doth approach.
But when the winter season came
But who abandon it--as I
But where Melpomene doth rave
But will not modify a tittle--
By absence who hath chilled his love,
But wretched who anticipates,
By children and by faithful wife
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
By computation) it is like
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
By every proper-minded wife,
By rank as settled by the State.
By other thoughts be occupied.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
By such allusions scandalous,
By sympathy I have been driven.
Callous to all on earth become--
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:
By neighbouring families bewept,
Canto the First of this romance.
By indolence and languor fired
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
Chained to his bedside night and day
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
By what idea or observation
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
Companion of my childhood's days.
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Conscious of death approximate,
Customs by ages sanctified,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Carried away by ecstasy,
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
"Departed Lenski here to dine
Descended swift in turbid streams
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.(69)
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Deep into debt his father ran;
Debate commanded ample food--
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Descried before me suddenly!
At first for books was disinclined,
At forty suffered from the gout,
At Larina's abode produced
"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At the front gates, but in brief space
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A young and handsome galliard.
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
But first permission did request
Beats that of friends and relatives:
But from the Muses' loftiest height
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But not at present, though sincerely
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
But time flies and she doth forget
But you must both be quite tired out!
But, her own room in memory,
But presently she tried to read;
But proudly in his song preserved
By bee and butterfly which pass.
But now--what brings you to my feet?--
By the sick lady's gaiety
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?"
A true account and in detail.
By whom the youthful bard was slain?"--
Carried a truth divine away;
Charming with grave simplicity.
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Commence a new career in life
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Dark was the valley and the wood
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Desire to rule ye may observe
Detest him for a brother slain?
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Discovered much absurdity,
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Distinctly not its mechanism.
Distracted by her grief appears
Do me a favour and appear.
Domestic life attracts me still,
But if the truth I must relate,
Constant affection intertwined
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Can we not stealthily make out
"Delighted."--"When?"--"This very night.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Doth in us or our names appear
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Dressed like a London dandy he
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Endless conjectures all propound
Endowing us from out her store
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay--
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
Epicurean philosophers,
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Eugene at first began to dream,
Eugene would speak regarding these.
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
Even beneath her parents' roof
Eventually petrify
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Examined, mended, newly found
Existence calmly sped along,
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Examine her from head to foot.
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Existence without wife or friends,
Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
Exist--that their immortal band
Fair source of every fine idea,
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
For ever faithful will abide."
For every loyal Russian breast!
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
For first "madame" his wants observed,
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
For evermore is separate.
For him an honourable grave,
For long--for ever. To be sure
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For my wild garden and bookcase,--
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For the impatient chief instead.
For there he left a mournful trace.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
First reconciled and then content;
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Feeling in others much esteemed.
Felled a calumniator base!
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
For journalistic deglutition
For our Automedons are fire
For summer to the country flown,
For twice you came to them and yet
For visions of my childish years
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?
Found them in darkness side by side,
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
For your instruction here to tell
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Fragments of northern poetry,
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Even amusing fools we miss
Friends of the sons of every land,
From apprehension of the cost,
From everything the heart held dear
From first to last page to the rim.
From careless stanzas such as these,
From gales a hill behind was seen;
From Gottingen inspired he came,
From happy inspiration flow,
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
From mere vacuity of mind
From hence engrossed in thought profound
From public and from private ties,
From shades of the relentless past.
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
From Romulus unto our day.
From whose analysis minute
Full many a lovely star hath night
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
Full of exasperating thought.
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
Funeral amateurs abound!
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
Gazing upon a note below.
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Give me just half a glass of wine--
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Glory with which our history teems
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
God grant that all who herein glance,
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
Gravely repeating to another
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Had bid her sigh for without hope--
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
God save his soul eternally
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Happy he who in youth was young,
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Habit alleviates the grief
Habit was given us in distress
"Had he been long here, and where from?
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Had come both friends and enemies--
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Happy who thereto can unite
Happy who timely grew mature,
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Hateful the hollow world became,
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Grant that I err not on the road."
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
Had perished a creative mind,
Hard by the window took her place."--
Had rendered him an invalid;
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Haughty appear, subservient,
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Have my Oneguine--suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Have echoed to eternity.
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Had finished life amid his sons,
Having for money's sake alone
Having performed his service truly,
Having this mournful document
Heaved an involuntary sigh
He "Benedetta" used to hum,
He back as from a sudden blow?--
He brought from mystic Germany
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
He called upon me Christmas Eve--
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He enters. High the cork arose
He is a charming youth and wise.
He bends his course to Talon's, where
He deemed of human life the goal
He felt the laudable desire
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
He had excepted from the ban:
He is not there: I am not known:
He in imagination saw
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
Having once fixed your interest,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He kindled his poetic flame.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
He obstinately will remain,
He has returned, say in what guise?
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He hath acquired the world's esteem
He now a full possession takes,
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her with a smile old women greet,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He sang of love--to love a slave.
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
He conversation would have led--
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
He enters: rapidly discussion
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her stares--
He found him on the table laid,
He on the conflagration frowned.(74)
He quits the fashionable throng
Her amorous experience
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her brow she did not e'en contract
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her garden, and those books of hers,
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
He sang of separation grim,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
He racked his brains to find its clue
Her all in all did constitute;
Her antiquated mode of speech,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He read as vainly as before,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Here bottles stand in close array,
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
Here I remark all poets are
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her utterances ever heard,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her path across the plain doth keep--
Her heart importunately turns.
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her glance how wild yet genial!
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
He thought to write, but labour long
He took no more the slightest heed;
He used to hate--and was no fool--
He was most gay. The happy date
He went not--sooner was prepared
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her money counted, and designed
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her toilette's antiquated style,
He's a freemason, so we think.
He took the room wherein the old
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
He wakes--they with a letter come--
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
He was a dear delightful fool--
He was an honest gentleman,
He to the festival repairs,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He who economy abhorred,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He with an innocence extreme
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
He who life's frosts which early wrung
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He with his little maiden played,
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Highways all Russia will unite
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Him a disquietude did seize,
Himself transformed into a hack;
His ardent soul with full delight.
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
And lessons to his children read.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Around her neck, now violently
Around the garden homeward hies.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Are turned upon her. All combine
Aroused in him some tenderness.
A shape half cat and half a crane.
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
As formerly much agitation.
As giddy youth's hilarity--
As every journal now entreats,
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
As if against obstruction sore
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As many dinners I rehearse,
A single being: 'twas in fine
As if he cruelly had joked!
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Assuredly should not have been
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As it were, tore himself away.
A sportsman who in covert lies.
As the sins of my youthful days
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
A strong resemblance these possess--
Asunder was and hate prepared?
As partner of my mournful days,
As rosy lips without a smile,
As yet none had discovered aught;
As bees who leave their dainty store
As if it were some funeral feast.
At each extreme one takes his stand,
At eighteen not to play the fool!
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
A tangled wilderness around.
Attentive listened to his speech,
At Russ she was by no means clever
Attentive to the echoing sound,
At times to silence would resort,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
A valuable hostage gained,
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Blest be the labours of the light,
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Besides, a duellist well-known
Bedding is laid out and to all
Born of a babbler in a loft
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
But, after mutual compliments,
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But competition I abjure
"But death from him will be delight.
Away her golden earrings tore;
But fashionable hatred's flame
But finally he oped his eyes
But finally she heaves a sigh,
But gray Phillippevna the door
But he who by the Muse was nursed
As in their turn the seasons roll.
As we lure the young gallant,
As Winter in their purity,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
At a great feast against desire,
At home arriving he addressed
A timid love to banishment?--
At last my father gave his blessing,
At last the author!" cries Mamma.
At least by show of sympathy;
At first, I clung to secrecy:
At least their accents and their words
Because her passion wanted art,
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Believe me, of my present shame
Because in singleness of thought
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
At times, if only once a week,
Avenge himself in proper style.
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Because she was so innocent,
Become a faithful wife and e'en
Attractive in its banefulness?
Before such fond simplicity
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--
But I await thee: scarce alive
At womankind he growled a curse,
Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
Bringing his partner corpulent
Behold! the world's opinion!
But boldly I myself resign:
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
But by degrees the crowd begin
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
But I must add to what I write
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But if my lot unfortunate
But I must now employ my Muse
But lo! already the moon's light
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
But I--what is all this to me?
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But man of sense and probity.
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But look you--ah! do not refuse."
But no reply unto her made.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
But borne in spirit far away
But grant with magnanimity
But now all doubt was set aside,
But now my mind is desolate,
But of this love, e'en casually,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But one thought only filled his mind,
But promise of our meeting gave,
Athwart the snow four paces came--
At times my reason almost bends,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
But it grew late; he must not stay;
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But send your grandson before long."
But she, her sister never heeding,
But as to fighting--'twill appear!
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
But somehow there shone in his look
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But once more pensive and distressed
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
But that the eyes of every one
But the dark sepulchre I may
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But this adventure's consequence
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But this amusement delicate
But trusted the ideal she wrought?--
But what astonished do I find
But when two minutes she had sat,
But stares into the darkness deep.
"But which, my dear?--In days of yore
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
But why are your cheeks whitening?"
By a rich pie were occupied--
By "belle Tattiana" to replace.
By dull insensibility,
By Olga's hand distributed
By Olga stood, dejected quite
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
By time (who can anticipate?)
By night prepared for sorcery,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Can count the time without much fuss--
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Caricatures he now designed
Careless of fame his spirit high
Certainly not Eugene alone
Command him not to say a word--
"Command me, darling, what you choose"
Change of position had essayed,
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Contented and with victuals stored,
"Do not--you might--suspicious be;
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
Drank to her health in the first place,
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--
Delusions of a mind untried,
Eight rubbers were already played,
Certain misfortune near opined.
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Eugene of course related nought,
But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Come sing we in chorus
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
"Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Confront thy fated torturer!
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--
Conventionality's dull tool--
Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Depart in peace and friendly live?
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Demands that I translate for you
Departed, ordered out his horse
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Diminishes as years decline.
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
Dreaming herself the heroine
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Either with him or thee in song,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Encountered punishment complete,
Enhances love in estimation
Ere the bright messenger had set.
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Ere conversation could begin,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Even as Moscow, city proud.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
Device of rural minds acute!)
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Excruciate the heart and late
For on their brows I trembling read
For patience, reader, I must plead!
For long he had endured them all.
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
From habit or maliciously,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Four deadly paces do they span;
From storms protection having sought,
From her half-open vest of night.
From the moist cork the bottle freed
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Had run across her path at speed,
Even as the love of children dear.
Gazing into his face, she said:
From such digressions wholly free.
God knows! The very trace is lost.
Having lost all in life we prize.
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
Cunning already to display
Espy him approaching,
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Except one by the window placed
Fantastic images shall swarm
Finally tost his arms in air
Fashion is there immutable,
For consecrate to me he fell
For evermore had disappeared.
For I myself was thirteen quite;
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
Forgotten in the village lone,
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
For o'er a word to fashion known,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Gliding in negligent career,
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Friends and companions,
From the dread pistol turn away.
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
God grant I meet not at a ball
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
For who imposture can endure,
Furious he from the table rose;
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Had killed me had the like been told."
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
Hears not my importunity!
He bending whispered in her ear
He _cannot_ give me happiness."
He cared no longer there to stay,
He could in disputation shine
He deemed his coming would inspire
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
He feared the criminal might try
Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
Had much to do at home that day,
He drops his pistol silently.
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Have entered never to return.
"He hath neglected us of late."--
He might his motives have narrated,
He ought to have conciliated
"He promised here this day to ride,"
Her agitation and distress
Girls in anticipation skip!
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He loved the simpleton to mock,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
He found them in an almanac,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
He on his bosom gently placed
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her head upon her breast declines
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
   "He's here! Eugene is here!
A windmill too a jig performs
Beside the thundering abyss
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
But cannot anyhow evade
"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
But finally in wedlock bind.
Bruin is marching at her back!
But he desired not to beguile
But I came not to adulate:
But merely to exasperate;
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But now our minds are mystified
But followed the strict rules of art,
"But strange am I to happiness;
But shall depict the touching scene
By daily life deteriorated,
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
By melancholy fogs concealed.
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But to the garden once again
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Byron's capricious phantasy
By an avowal just as plain.
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
Cannot they amicably smile
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
Could in romantic mantle drape
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Do not excuse yourself. I read
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
Charming is your sincerity,
Dressing as quickly as he can,
E'en for an instant find delight,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
For us, may be for many a year.
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Eugene directs the trusty man
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Had a deluded victim been
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
Ever to hear the same replies
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
He dragged her by a forest road
He heard his soul's complaint within,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He in the early years of life
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Found the ideal of my youth,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Habit would bring indifference.
He offers her his murderous paw;
He long should have been on the road.
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
Her handkerchief she loses now;
He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
He's a straightforward little chap."
He still made love in a queer way;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He would not that a man ye slay
Him who inspired both love and awe,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He usually was glad to see
He was deceived. Just as before
He wanders in his indolence;
He was no more! The youthful bard
He was in error; for Eugene
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He there is master--that is plain;
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His character attracted me.
His comedies, a noisy rout,
His double sashes and his grate,
His chambers close wherein confined
His course unto the running brook.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
His ditties were as pure and bright
His constant soul could ever tire,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His daughter's book to ascertain
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
His care unto his pistols' plight,
His daily occupations, lo!
His breast was riddled through and through,
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His son and mortgages his lands.
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Honour and pride inflexible.
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
His fate shall presently decide.
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
His footing on the treacherous rime
His energy and impotence.
His friends and also enemies
His friendship I acquired just then;
His furs are powdered on the way
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
His harp beneath that sky had rung
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His hate by slander, and who spends
His heart reciprocated still
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
His inner consciousness laid bare,
His intellect in close array.
His malady, whose cause I ween
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His momentary loving glance
His own antagonists expert,
His immorality of mind
His mother from the door doth scold.
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
His relative and friend as well.
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
His kneeling posture he retains--
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
His uncle, busy man indeed,
His vanity first let us pique
His ruffian bravery adored,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
His visit she had not awaited,
His watch, the sun in turn he views--
His wife approaches, with him leads
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Hope with her fascinating power
His name: the tenderness of home
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
How artless was the note which spoke
How bright and tender was his look,
"How came you then to wed a man?"--
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
However cherries might abound,
However, Tania's letter reading,
How empires store of wealth unfold,
His son is married, just conceive!"
His soul by crash of music fired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
His recent glory he invokes.
His transports were quite maidenly,
His wife was also mad upon
His weary head declined at rest,
His travels like all other things
Homeward returning, he at home
His spirit was intent upon.
Horror! had she not better stay
How bitterly he would malign,
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
However, the mazurka lacks
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"--
How full of fire his speech would glow!
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How I have erred and felt the rod!
How in the country pass this time?
How like a poet was my chum
His valet brings him letters three.
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How much is in that word expressed!
"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
"How often in thine arms I lay;
How like the billow I desired
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
How oft the kindly Muse away
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How oft to the Crimean shore
How oft, when on a summer night
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt deception's art,
How soon he learnt to titillate
How meekly then I heard you preach--
How soon to habits she conformed
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear"
How with thy medal I would play,
How thoroughly her part she took!
How well he played the greenhorn's part
Hung like a print against the wall,
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
I am in love, my hour hath come!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
I also wandered there of old,
"I am in love," her whispers tell
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
I ask, all ye who poets are,
"I call to witness God on high--"
I cannot help it I declare,
I cannot understand. But lo!
I can't conceive a little dear
If he had only known the wound
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
I feel thou wast by God sent down
If seriously he hath disease;
If the fond hope I could have fanned
If the poor maiden could have guessed
I guard it as a holy thing,
I had found my predestinate,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Immersed in melancholy thought,
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
I Apuleius gladly read
I, after so much eloquence,
I am not worthy them in aught;
I cannot tell on what pretence--
I cannot longer wage concealed.
I cannot tell the reason why,
I can't translate the adjective.(83)
"I celebrate a comrade young
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
I blame not your behaviour--
I did not please you. Why pursue
I envied sore the billows tall,
Idolatry of liberty,
I feel, allotted is my span;
If cleverly or not I prate.
If in the scenes of home I might
If not, the money I will lend."
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
If Olga smilingly approve,
I formerly admired her much
"If the domestic hearth could bless--
If the raw product they possess
If they but heard domestic loads
If the choice in my power were,
If wife and children to possess
If they were similar in aught.
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
I have dreamed many a vision fair
I have endured without respite.
I have no leisure here to dwell,
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
I am not strong enough to state;
I lift a warning voice because
If his hot hand encountered hers,
I like the difference to express
I like this word exceedingly
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
I long by ballets have been bored,
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
I love its furious delight,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Impatient waits the close of day,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
I loved you--what did I obtain?
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
Imperial portraits hang around
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Impelled to union with his own
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
I must resign myself, in sooth;
In books he saw nought to condemn
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
In course of time (the whole extent
In cruel solitude each day
Indeed, by force of magnetism
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Inflict annoyance and distress
In coach or post-cart duly placed
In groups, official striplings glance
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
In haunts of fashion where each day
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
In her friends' albums, time had been,
In love adventures she was versed,
In company, or simply bowed,
I love you--to what end deceive?--
I married--now, I supplicate--
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Impressed him in the least degree,--
In consultation stand aside--
Impressionable for an hour,
In a lax or informal way,
          Indifferent and sedate,
In bud of promise incomplete,
Indifferent he became to all,
In duel having killed his friend
Inhabited the country, clad
Inheritor of all his race.
Imagination's sacred fires,
Indifferent was her future fate.
In fact, some people were assured
In former years thus did not I
In history he took no pleasure,
In hopes of everlasting fame
In love-lorn meditation sad.
In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
In idleness and tranquil joy
In many things had changed his life--
In mist profound all yet is hid.
I by the button-hole seize fast
I heard thy voice's resonance
I just hint, in parenthesis,
I love you with a brother's love,
Imagine! Here alone am I!
I have known beauties cold and raw
I'm beaten in another matter;
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
I know not if his heart felt pain
I know that Parny's tender pen
I know there's none more amiable.
I mean my name not to repeat."
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
Impetuously clove its way
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
In age the memory gets worse,
In a half-open dressing-gown
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In boston and the game of age,
In charming fashion mutilate?
In clouds of steam above perceive.
Incited by his stormy Muse
In correspondence been allowed.
In country solitude you mope,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
In country towns, where still it keeps
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
In fact, the subject analysed,
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
I never should have seen your face
In horror for itself alone,
In life domestic see a string
In dreams and what the moon foretold
Infallibly you there will find
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In little maidens of thirteen?
Incessantly his chains to break."
I long enough deceived have erred.
In love, although its tempests vex,
In melancholy loveliness,
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
In my young days of wild delight
In motley and amusing chase.
In old age life is weariness!"
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
In much his conduct stigmatized;
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
In one thing really did excel.
In one he doth accounts behold,
In order due the maidens pull;
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
In pages of a love narration
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
In Russ her love made manifest,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
In scenes like these it may be though,
Insensible her hand remains
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
Inseparable soon they be.
Inseparable from our lot;
Inseparable they remained.
In serious mood or dalliance
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
In rhyming I show laziness.
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
In silence shall I sit and yawn
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
In solitude or worldly din,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
In solid, unpretentious style,
In some a willing martyrdom.
Inspired but weariness intense;
Inspired him with disgust and so
In spite of common sense we're wont
In springtime on the meadows green,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
In one of thine enchanting lays
In such an album with delight
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
In the beginning, cold and mute,
In the beginning of this lay,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
In the dawn of existence drear.
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In the French language perfectly,
In times gone by thy bare command--"
Into delicious bondage gave
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
In that morass where you and I
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
In the first place, say, am I right?
In the meantime the mill inspects.
In the unmoved, magnificent
In their sterility of prattle,
In the recesses what hath stirred
In the world's mortal revelries,
In this the love of the fair sex
In the world's vortex my success,
In time I'll give ye without fail
Into accounts would sometimes look,
In the unfettered hours of leisure
Into the cups already sped
Into the chamber where he slept
Into the district then to boot
In thy imagination warm,
Into the lonely house she went,
Into the starry night extend.
Into the study of the boy
In winter by its blank and dim
In this case quite mistaken was.
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Introduce verse in conversation.
In true interpretation hates:
In truth he had the happy trick
In whispers low the neighbours said:
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
In winter on the fender bright,
In winter time would often come.
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
In winter, when Night longer holds
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In your young days and also mine),
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I on my chosen hero dote;
I owe the censorship a little.
In what he merely acquiesced.
In vain was youth by us received,
Invigorate imagination
In worldly din or solitude
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
I sail upon my lake at times
Is ever ready with relief,
"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Is ever ready to proclaim
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
Is full of frigid jealousy,
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
I should alarm our friendship tried:
"I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
Is it that human restlessness
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Lenski as a good match received,--
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Minutely I will now portray.
Men become friends from idleness.
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Is it for long?"--"Ma chere cousine!"
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
November at the gate did stand.
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Into the tangled garden goes
Napoleon tarried till it please
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
No greater pleasure can exist
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Not so! My Moscow never went
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
No senseless fashionable lay
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of Olga he in song averred;
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
One instrument for his own use--
One moment's slumber suffer not.
On horseback every day they ride--
On winters of the south a skit,
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Ourselves as unities to count;
Interrogation to denote.
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Is occupied with Olga fair,
(I speak not of our poems here),
It carries of antiquity
It may be that I did proceed--
Its ebullition foaming white
I slumber much, a little read,
"Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
Is still condemned in love to be;
Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
It will be by a mob beset
I yield for splendid vanities,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
I yield the fruit of work severe.
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
Just at a moment which I grieve
Just at the hour we designate
Just manages a feeble trot
Its driver seated on the rim
Is once again made manifest.
It may be ye were born, or there
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.(75)
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,(71)
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Lay languishing both day and night--
Let me present ye to the man,
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Let us go seek a little rest--
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
(Like other things I could relate)
Lenski at intervals would dare,
Listless is she the livelong day
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Look through the window and kill flies.
Lost in the hamlet far away.
"Long since I held thee at the font--
Man--forty years long in this wise--
Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Make up your mind to go there."--"Ah!
Men love no more, as only the
"Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
"Monsieur l'Abbe," a starving Gaul,
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Morality taught scarce at all;
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Most by this circumstance offended
Must be pronounced unfortunate--
Most usually a Cossack horse
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Next Saturday. The Larina
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Near Khariton's in a side street
No other book had time to read.
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor discontinued to distress
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
No sense was ever manifest
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor years of separation all
"Not in the least, assured am I!"
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Obedient she had ever been
Obedient then to Nature's law,
My venerated reader, oh!
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
Of every sort and every set!"
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
Of her provincial innocence
Of horn in circle call them round.
Of many an economic scheme;
Of passion reminiscences,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!"
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Old women at the coachmen swear.
"Olinka is her junior, see.
Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
Made revelations undesigned,
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Metreless verses recognizing
My heart of old would captivate.
My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
Must now my stanzas occupy.
My very latest composition!
My little book. With thee I knew
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Of roses to romancers dear;
Of foreign whims the impersonation--
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Of what he thought and what believed,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Of friends the grateful intercourse--
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
Oneguine was--so many deemed
Oneguine was the most impressed,
One image occupied his mind,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
Oh, many a year hath run its course
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
Oppressive now is happiness,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Or faults of grammar on its page--
Or quietly partake our woe.
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Or, parable more flattering,
Or parody of modern ways?
Our liberty at least survives:
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Outlandish and provincial,
Outside descend the mists of night.
Or by a card our homage pay,
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
Past palaces and nunneries,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Pedantic although scholar like,
Pelagie Nikolavna has
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
I say without poetic phrase,
Is petted by the Emperor?--
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
I still a complication view,
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
I the same admonition make.
I then resolved my heart to tear;
I thought--retirement, liberty,
I thank thee. In thy company,
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
Its splendour and its blandishments,
It gradually possessed his mind;
It may be, I yield nutriment!
It may be that his martyred shade
It occupied him from a boy,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
I tried when I began this tale,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
It now to investigate is time,
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
It wakens in my breast again.
It was a cheery, generous
It whiled his idle hours away
Its insignificance I know
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
I was half silly with affright.
I was incensed and he was sad.
I will with thy divinity
"I with my friend intend to fight!"
Jaws are at work. On every side
Jealousy and vexation took
Jilted--glad of a holiday.
I write, and anguish flies away,
Just at this moment I cannot.
I would not part with finally;
Know that thy face that day I see.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Let me explain that in my song
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Lest jaded with satiety,
Let us congratulations pay
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
I would desire my bride to be--
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
Just as he entered. How severe!
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Lest the malicious reader or
Lest the world or her lord divine
Like a full moon magnificent.
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Like down from Aeolus's lip,
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Longer the East inert reclines
Long in this fashionable cell
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Long, long the hour had past when home
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Laid down his life of sun and storm
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
Long time in meditation deep
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Love's tender transports and distress,
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Lo! with what pride celestial
Love to idealize inclined;
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Many an ancient legend which
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
I've wasted in amusements vain,
"I weep. And if within your breast
I've had to make for having friends!
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
I would your vigilance arouse,
I write to you! Is more required?
I yield with a low reverence;
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Just at that time his father died,
I was for calm existence made,
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
I uttered to my lady fair
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Known unto children perfectly:
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Latest arrivals' salutations,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Lead into good society,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Learn to possess more self-control.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lessons to give he understood!
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Like his, her dress was always nice,
Like Leonora did she ride(79)
Likewise an epitaph with tears
Like you and me and all the rest?--
List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Like him renouncing vanity,
Lo! in my garden was she found
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Listen to me without disdain.
Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Long time her young imagination
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Malignant fury they disclose,
Mark ye with what a modest air
May be, and this my terror wakes,
May be that I by heaven's decrees
May be the empire of the sense,
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Maidens before her meekly move
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Malicious and a slanderer.
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,(85)
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
May well in innocence impart.
Meantime in matutinal dress
May yet be studious of his nails;
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Meantime Oneguine's apparition
Meet punishment for him provide.
"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
Method was dear unto his heart
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Modest yet daring! And a tear
More blooming than the Boreal flame
More crimson every moment they.
More satisfaction to her taste.
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
More timid than a doe long chased,
Moina recalls for this alone
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
Miraculously fair arise,
Mournful is thine approach to me,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
My country's honour and repute
Merciful God, what will he deem?"
Must take a walk and rest a bit--
"My darling child, thou art in pain.--
My famous portrait indicate
My friends, what means this odd digression?
My doom has been pronounced on high,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My light productions to retain,
My memory wandered wide and sought
My heart's allegiance can resign,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My mother-in-law who lately died
"My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
My scholar without aptitude
My soul I cannot renovate--
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My splendid house and gaieties--
My gratitude do not disdain,
My guardian angel to the grave.
"My heart's delight, thou art not well."--
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My spirit with such pangs before.
My sportive Muse I used to take
My image hath not disappeared,
Mysteriously all objects near
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
My unpretending page shall fill,
My word of honour given have I.
My pen no longer finds delight,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
Men will forget me, but my urn
Measured with great exactitude.
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
More advantageously appear
No coquetry was there, I vouch--
Me your perfections would not bless;
More troublesome than usual?"--"No!
Noblesse and models of the mode,
"No matter, look immediately.
"No misery I see in that"--
No more remembered him; unto
Night separated from her spouse,
No more the music thunders loud,
No more with pale Diana's rays,
None could her beautiful declare,
None could a trace of that impute,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Me now, inflict upon me pain?--
Must bow in common courtesy;
My morning birdie, yesternight
No, ever to behold your face,
"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
My beauty, thou art ready too.
My country and an exile's lot;
Near young Tattiana resident,
No answer all that day was borne.
Never for me to reappear--
No fond illusions live to soothe,
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
No more the village knows his face,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
No one the contrary will urge,
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Nor further comment that night made.
Not even a poetic phrase,
No signs of trouble her accused,
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
Not to behave as he did once--
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Nought of its charms original
Now all things round about repeat
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
No, never in the early blaze
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now talkative, now reticent;
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
Now with what eager interest
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Never upon my heroine
My heart with but one look revive;
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
"My darling, growing old am I!
My days of life approach their end,
No longer through her former home;
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
No one my anguish comprehends,
My pretty self-deceiving maid--
My sum of happiness contained;
None the conviction could withstand
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
No answer! He another sent.
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Not high in general estimation;
Of all the guests within his mind.
Of a strange night when the moon and--
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Of affectation innocent,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
O feet, where'er your path extends
Of fiery youth's untutored days
Of conversation, thought and aims--
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Of languor and of love did tell
Not the least trace Oneguine sees
Of late I have been quite absurd,--
Of London life is "vulgar" called
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Of Levshin's school ye followers,(67)
Of old maids the divinity,
Of modern Russians the disease.
Of one thing till again we met.
Of passion they so often raise.
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
No obstacle of which I know.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Nor even tears afford respite,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
No novelty--is it not true?--
No other than Oneguine mine.
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not knowing its interpretation,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not all will like myself proceed--
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
No trace ye left in passing by
Nought in the universe refused:
Now, as in a deserted house,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
Now I am ready to refuse.
Not that she had his works perused,
Now it is ready to be sent--
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
Obedient to the magic strings,
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
Of censure for the same incurred;
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Now of a family the head,
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Obsequious or indifferent!
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Of consolation all bereft--
Of a most mournful episode,
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
Of creditors a hungry rout
Of error and the passions' strife.
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Of friends unceremonious would
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Of love again, and yet again;
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
Of migratory gipsy hordes--
Of my light paramour was proud.
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
Of tender years the modesty
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of the commencement of the piece.
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Of the night sentinels arise
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
(One and the same thing it may be)
Oneguine meditative stood,
Oneguine Olga bore away.
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Oneguine was a citizen
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Or any trifle else ye like
Oneguine went with trepidation
On guests their servants used to wait
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Or even overcome by wrath
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
Or counting on his uncle's death
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Or other mask donned playfully?
Opened the portals of the tomb
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Or bosom full of languid fire,--
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Of the Aeneid, but incorrect.
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Of priceless value all things seem
Of the horizon she is like!"--
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Of touching lightly every theme.
Oft staring through the window pane
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
Olga's admirer came that day:
Olga the tea must supervise--
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Once more to idleness consigned,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
Oneguine could not now submit,
Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
"Oneguine, I was younger then,
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
Oneguine sat the table by
Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
Oneguine--take him up again--
On innocent delights I dote,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Only her countenance assumed
On sunny days the glistening rime,
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
On us beyond the grave attends,
Or better,--like a faithful wife.
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or but for fame he saw the light;
On whom a sister's heart was set
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
Original imagination,
Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
Oneguine--the beloved place
On Sundays by yon window he,
Opened with care, and entering bore
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Opens unto her visitor.
Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.(81)
Or for the solitary tomb
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Oneguine then approached and said:
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or that adoring Grandison
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Or torturer malevolent?
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Pallid and melancholy face,
Paris and Menelaus right.
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Passed into dull eternity,
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Perchance they laurels also cull--
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
Philanthropist or patriot,
Page after page continued reading,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Poetic transport. They impart
Polite demeanour to preserve,
"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
On everything around her gaze,
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Our union would produce but grief.
Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Placed at the customary range;
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Possess my love and sympathy.
Poetical enthusiast,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Pray is it not a tough affair
Passes the torrent But alack!
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Presents her quarto amiably,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Portrayed contemporary man
Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Returning, from his ship amid
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Scornfully challenged you afield--
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
Providence otherwise may deem--
Quite a sensation; the position
Resounding through all ages might
Seek the forgotten countenance
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
(See the first canto if ye will),
She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
She hears of conversation nought
She leisurely away doth ride,
She on the apparition gazed,
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
Longtime was her heart desolate
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Of life or death predestinate.
Of my impassioned heroine.
Of Russian domesticity;
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
On balls I madly used to dote,
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Of the romances she preferred,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Of your perfections in my soul,
Oh! I accept. And instantly
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Olga began to long likewise
O Men, how very like ye are
Old people's simple conversations
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Oneguine acted very well
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
Oneguine, bored to death again,
Oneguine his excuses says;
Oneguine slowly then began
Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
Oneguine to the window went
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
On fresh allurements they are bent,
Oneguine wasted; on my word,
On lines invisible are fixt;
Olga with trepidation dire.
Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
On melted wax in water poured;
Olga he sees before his eyes
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
On unknown female forms he throws.
Open the window--sit by me."
On this artistical retreat
Or a professor in tulle cap.
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Oneguine's Letter to Tattiana
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
Or even, silent and resigned,
Or letters of a maiden young.
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Or the delivery of a note.
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
On the dull stage find all things changed,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Or innocently past me fly.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Or will my melancholy glance
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Pardon I ask for such a sin--
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Past darkened windows and long streets
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance one more affectionate.
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
Possession hath no power to please,
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Raises within my breast as oft
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Portray the solitary den
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Repentance wields not now her spell
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Reviews both dress and countenance,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Russia's Terpsichore review
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Rings from a dish of water full
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
Shall my declining years beguile;
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Sailed silently in unison--
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
She deemed its outline might afford.
She did not think "procrastination
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
She sits alone--'tis ever _she_!
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
She promised Eugene, or she would
She the delicious novel reads,
She waited for--I don't know whom!
She was as heedless and as gay--
Should dearly like a dance again.
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
Since leisure was together spent,
Sickness more courage doth command
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
So ardently did I desire
So be it! But internal strife
"She who with melancholy face
Society renounced once more.
So frequently his mind would stray
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
So full of piety, correct,
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
So inaccessible to men,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Some Russian authors he perused--
Or recognized not in the crowd.
perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
Relate some ancient history."
Received him freely at her house,
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Round which revolves the universe.
Sails her allotted course on high,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Scarce to her questions he responds,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
She mourned and to the moon would raise
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
She murmurs in an undertone
She never of deception dreamed
She seeks the garden in her need--
She seemed of him oblivious,
Should make me much more circumspect,
She will not see, she will not hear.
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Society endures not such!
Slow circling round its fellow swings
So from the mountain lazily
So irremissible appear?
So let us to the ball-room haste,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Some a mazurka occupies,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
So, when he came next day to call,
So she in French herself expressed.
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still everywhere, without, within,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Straight from their province had he come?"--
Striking the intellect with awe
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana certainly infers
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Suddenly to the left hand side,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
Tattiana in the yard appears
Tattiana's Letter to Oneguine
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Tattiana's letter I possess,
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Tender and elevated, free?
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
Than health, so with a trembling hand
That all may hear his voice's tone.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
That every morn at Verrey's cost
That for that matter in my verse
That girl--but he must dreaming be--
That, for the century designed,
That glimmered through the radiant night
That girl whom once on a time he
That guests approach: and when above
That he was "ready any day."
That vicious set whom I don't blame--
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,(84)
That Heaven her character had blent
That hero, though his merit shone,
That Nina's marble symmetry,
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
That I to you reveal my mind?
That the two friends with morning's light
That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The crowd and merriment and light,
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The excited hero in a trice
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The idols of their adoration
The all-entrancing joys of love--
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The break of day she doth not see,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The country hath its liberties
The blessings of humanity.
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The conversation was revived
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The crystals of her vestibule
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The disenchanted glass direct
The deuce with my inside has played."
The drive becomes monotonous--
The evanescent fashions fly
The fair of the next generation,
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived(65)
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The general who accompanies.
The drama of my youth was played.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The days which to your youth belong?
The friend of liberty and laws
The epistle from the bard presents.
The gilding of life's vanities,
The goddess would a masquerade
The hours once more Oneguine counts,
The husband comes and interferes
The image of her seal impressed.
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
The matter by his conscience tried,
The mystic lines to tear away
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The lively trash of stories long
The native Russian tongue impeach?
Then in the silent cabinet
That heart with inspiration sweet
The artful prisoner should seek
The artifice of villany--
The ball in all its splendour shone.
The bard his answer waits at home,
The aged nurse in ample gown,
The aged woman in her woe:
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
The clue unto some mystery
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The contact of the foot I raised
The glass unwittingly inspect
The indignation of her heart!
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
The drum already doth arouse.
The fatal hour had come at last--
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fever of the blood to slake--
The fated nutriment desired;
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The fires of passion and its smart--
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
The man and liked his company,
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The German baker looks around
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
Then be it so! My destiny
The God of Love is after you!
"Then send your grandson quietly
Then he'd malign them secretly
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then to some gallant in your turn
The opportunity is flown.
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The perfidies I recollect
The Paris of those country parts
The sad moon only could remark.
The sum of my existence gone
The triumph of a conquest new.
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Then ye were barely generous,
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
There Didelot became glorious,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
There our Katenine did revive
The stomach doth admonish us.
The time when Melancholy's claw
They shovel silver with a spade,
The witching light of sympathy;
They were the wonderful traditions
This gentle daring who could guess?
Thine honour is my countersign!
The sneers of critics superfine;
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
The Russian language I deem vile
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
This life in masquerade concealed,
This lot in life with stern decree?
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Though around honoured Priam's throne
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!"
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
To jest as he had done last eve,
To ease the anguish of my breast.
To friendship making no pretence,
To crush me with a just disdain.
To listen to the words you speak,
Together they returned, nor word
To loiter there in idleness
To lawless love I should prefer--
To mutter her concealed desire
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To lay two covers secretly.
To make wise men the idiot play
To pass the night at home hath gone.
To peer into the future tries.
The young Simeonova too there
To russify the foreign phrase
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
To the impressions of our youth,
To see you by our fireside stand,
To take this letter to O-- Well!
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
To the theatre he repairs
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Prevailed at last. She in reply
"Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Quick to the country let us wend
_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Raged round him and of balked desire!
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Regained authority awhile,
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Removed her to his country seat,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Rescue me from oblivion.
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Romances three, in which ye scan
Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Romance of love I pray refer,
Romances pleased her from the first,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Said something in an undertone
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
See, I can hardly crawl about--
Secure in rural quietude--
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Selfish nonentities around?
Seductive, animated, bright,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Serious endeavours to assure
Servant of God and brigadier,
Shaking with serious air the head,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She buries deep within her breast
She is an angel! We sometime
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Shall I behold thee once again?"--
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
She bows her head beneath the crown;(68)
She brought with her the gift of song.
She cannot--Eugene oped the door
She cannot--then impatiently
She from the winter corn espies
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
She enters a deserted yard--
She loved upon the balcony
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
She gazed around her--it was day.
She nerves herself from her alarm
She never more his face may view,
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She strains her throat to force a cry--
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
She soon forgot, began to call
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She comprehends. The simple maid
She found herself alone at last,
She consolation thence obtained--
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
She got a book of nursery tales,
She hears the bear behind her press,
She led me through nocturnal mist
She rose--departed. But Eugene
She sank.--
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
She, than the morning moon more pale,
She the acquaintances she loves,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
She visited the humble tents
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She was thus fond of Richardson
She wore her corset tightly bound,
She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
Since Eugene in that solitude
Society he duped enow."
Some are afar and some are dead.
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
So there will be a dance to-night.
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Sits down and gazes on all sides--
She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
So uncongenial to my mind,
Some other long-departed Spring,
(Surely you know him as I speak);
Singing in chorus all the while.
Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
Tattiana in the young princess!
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
The epitaph on marble shows:
Priams of country populations
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Tania the meaning would obtain
Tattiana every day conferred
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Tattiana with impatience waited
Terror of guardians of the night;
Tattiana purchased with a stray
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The captain of a company.
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The body they consigned to rest,
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
Tattiana to the index flies
The curse of commonplace delight.
The dream left terror in its train.
The feeble moment would espy
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The frolics of maidens.
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The family of Kharlikoff,
Thee but a little space bewept,
The forests in mysterious gloom
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The Larinas were since sunrise
The Maidens' Song
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The tiny sun shone less on high
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The military band will play.
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The Larinas would celebrate,
The secrets of maidens.
These evenings as in days of old
The servants used to congregate
Then, then--well, in some solitude
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The wolf upon the highways bold
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Shines in the female firmament
Should be respected throughout life
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
Should go, the market for a maid,
Shy, silent did the maid appear
Sighs on another than her lord
Spoiled children most degenerate
Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
Tattiana in traditions old
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Tania doth by the casement linger
Tattiana faltered, and became
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Tattiana gently led them there.
Tattiana motionless abides.
That crass stupidity misleads,
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Tattiana to a corner, bids
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The bridegroom sage without delay
The child of sloth and liberty.
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The conversation tedious
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Since in these arms I thee did bear--
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
Some nice instructive novel read,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Some one or other editor
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
slept o'er the river misty grown.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
So Tania to her heart's content
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
So many neighbours here exist--
So meantime let him joyous live
Some future ignoramus shall
Sometime collected, shall relate
(So 'twas with us in former years,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
snorts, and his rider bends his course
Some army poet therein may
Spared him not their asperities.
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Speech was so tame and colourless
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Still certain authors, I may add,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Strange unto her each childish game,
Straight for the entrance then he made
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Take to their wings and fly away.
Still of his club he member was--
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
That mediocrity alone
That grandmothers and grandsires may
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The door flew open--Olga came,
The calm existence which I prize
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
The dusty chronicles of earth
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
The gifted songster never swerved,
The girl in marriage they unite.
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
Successfully to please her tried,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Such is the country custom good;
Terror assails her. Hastily
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
The guests make room; aside each takes
The happiest days of life employ?
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
THE less we love a lady fair
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Such open-hearted innocence.
Surely ye all have overhauled
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
Tania, observed by nobody,
Tania well nigh expired when he
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Tattiana learns the intelligence--
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
That is, he could elucidate
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
That vanished are my youthful days
That our desires which noblest seemed,
The bays of age and helplessness.
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
That I forget not whom I sing.
Tattiana courage doth regain
That a friend's arm in every case
That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
The coach before a house stood still.
That afterwards with evil smile
The connoisseur his glances throws
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Than one's own fascinating self.
That certain volumes she might read.
Terpsichore alone among
That my dishonour would ensure
That we her constantly betrayed
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
That like a friendly voice its tone
The accents wild of other's woes,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The butt of scandal having been,
The channel of the river stilled
The china teapot too ye might
The converse of our hermits twain,
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Tattiana would have gladly heard
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
The crash of music, candles' glare
The cynosure of every eye.
The early days of life we sought.
The eyes of a grave general.
The family of children hie.
The damsel under escort place.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The father scarcely understands
The curs away to kennel chase,
The firmament in mellow light,
The fisher's fire afar illumes
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The first appearance of the snows
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The gulf between them was so vast,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
Tattiana was her appellation.
That until Christmas comes again
The amatory science warm,
That year the autumn season late
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The company deep silence guard.
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
The converse of the world polite,
The days of love and of romance!
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The hero we immortalize.
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The hostess doth interrogate:
The household troop of little boys,
Their own productions, some insist
The Lovelaces are out of date,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The natural fickleness of passion,
The credulous indeed are blest,
The fervid poet would recite,
The giddy world at last shall see.
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The hero's name too in advance,
The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
The house and garden I would see."
The household property contain:
Their glory with their heels of red
The language of her girlish pleading
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
The medium is required of gold.
Then dressed himself...
The hussar Pikhtin was accused.
Then handed her the song with grace.
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The letter is the thing, you see,--
The insensate fire of love still glowed
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
Then touching Olga they depart
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
The poet, modest though so grand,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
There is no stupid calumny
The maids beside Tattiana keep--
The poor girl fell into a faint,
There an imperious skeleton;
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
"The post hath kept him, it is like."
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
The Russian winter did adore
These are your relatives, believe:
The secrets of the marriage state
The shining river clothed in ice;
The shining orbs of night appear;
The snow upon the streets doth melt--
The story of thy life and fate.
The strife grew furious and Eugene
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
The trees in silvery array,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The two friends' compliments she hears
The torrent of opinion,
The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
The uncontaminated kiss
The mystic monogram, O. E.
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The world enough. Congratulate
The troop of apparitions fled,
The vestibule finds empty quite--
The wood she enters--bear behind,--
They are all natural and low,
They hand in hand to table go.
She could not sleep in her new bed.
The counsel good and full of reason,
The early tinkling of the bells
"The family are all quite well--
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The goblet still is bubbling bright--
The golden ember now enshrines,
The imagination to enliven
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The "in memoriam" pages sought,
The fruits of learning and combined
The last poor obol I was worth--
The path of hope and tender fear--
The time between the wolf and dogs--
They sent their compliments--but oh!
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Thou also, my ideal true,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
'Tis time she to the altar went!
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
To idle musing was a prey;
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
They shout and no one lists at all.
They would not solemnly debate
They may forget that we exist.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
They have invited you this week."
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
This monument of thought profound
This northern summer of our own,
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
Though now my love might be intense,
Though beauty he no more adored,
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
Time was when cold seduction strove
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Till January fell no snow--
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Together we have wandered o'er
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
To light had brought them from their dust,
Tome of "Malvina," and but three
To help her to the other shore
To my old nurse alone peruse,
To move in fashionable life,
To part in amity with thee!
To Olga frequently he would
To raise a clamour and a din:
(This by command; for it was found,
Though the foul vision promise made
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Till out of breath upon a seat
To purest love he tuned his note
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
To secrets of virgins,
To standards in which we believe?
To swagger as the art of love,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
To the fair object of his dream,
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
To thy decree my will I bend.
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
To whom are our misfortunes grief
Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
Triquet arose, and for the bard
Triumphant by anticipation,
Troy's sages should in concert own
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Turned to her and discordantly
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
"'Twas possible then, happiness--
'Twas these he read and these alone
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
To sigh and meditate alone:
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Two verses he could recollect
Undeviating and insane
On thee I used to meditate!
Their claims and explanations shout.
The inmate is for ever dumb,
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their memory lingers still and seems
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their Jealousy and separation
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their slander e'en was weariness;
Their privileged allurements fire
The journey in a sledge doth please,
Their voices nought to her impart
The kennel or a kindred line,
The lamps illuminating shine;
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The lady's glance upon him fell--
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
The laws of generations past,
The limits of enlightenment
The lancer, to his calling bound,
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
The lily's stem to eat away,
The maid whose note he still possessed
The Lord deliver her and save!
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The most industrious man alive
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
"Then amongst strangers I was left--
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The little solitary nook
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The monsters of the British Muse
The lonely mansion-house to screen
Then they came easily enow,
The olden time shall be my theme.
The old man who has had his freaks,
The Larinas unwisely went,
The pall of night was growing thin,
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The poet's fervid conversation
The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The powder in the pan is laid,
The path which leads to glory's goal.
The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
Their natural attractions lend
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The maiden at her casement sits
The manners of the highest class
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
The men salute with lower bows
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The moderns of the ancients rave--
Then weeping she sank back distressed
The miserable bard to meet,
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
The prejudices all men have,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
The remnant destiny concedes,
There was no angling for success.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
The serpent to unlawful trees
These to the coach of state are bound,
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,(66)
The simple epitaph--a tear
The snows from off the hills around
The snow descends and buries all,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Then they're so innocent of vice,
The malady of hopeless love
The memory of the bard was driven
The master always used to sit.
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining night--
The matter did not agitate,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
Then became busy with the house,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
The nights of golden Italy
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Then to reward such confidence
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The pervert world with icy chill
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Then, her distraction to allay,
The nightingale there all night long,
Then, the far capital forgot,
The poet fell; already men
The reaping girls approach and ply
The Princess N. will be at home
There came a sudden flash of light,
There, in that knot of company,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The princess from the sofa cried
There friends of pure delight had been
There is a spot the village near
There jars of cider block the way,
Thereon the passing traveller read:
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
The rigour of cold pride and all
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
The river through the linden wood.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
The room my former master used.
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
These take their seats; the coach of state
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly;
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The Russian N with nasal sound
The shutters open; to the skies
The sorrows of a single state.
The steward sent a note to tell
The story of his young love's dream,
The motley moving mass and bright,
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The strange apartment her oppressed:
The style in which my hero dressed;
The riot of the world and glare
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The starry beacons fade away,
The shining pistols are uncased,
The sun had mounted high his steep,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The venerable dame opined
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
The sudden rattling of a car.
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
The table with its lamp unlit,
The tale of these romantic men;
The time for mystic strolls which late
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The votary of vain delight
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
They crack a feeble joke and smile--
The weary way still incomplete,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
They deem her somewhat finical,
The style of wise antiquity.
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The unaffected traits she now
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The two old ladies then embraced
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The very morning of our days.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
The vile seducer shall not dare
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The wit of others to acquire.
The windows whitened, shutters close--
The woods, still naked to the view,
The workpeople she superintended,
The world is ever altering!
The works of Mr. Richardson.
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They in a peaceful life preserved
The wedding-day had been arranged,
They growl a bit--they scandalise--
Thither in future to proceed
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They long at home have her expected--
Though of romance therein I fail
The twilight pale which softens all,
They long ago had held debate.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
The youthful lover once again
They will receive us with delight."
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This is my master's sitting-room.
This separated us as well--
This was his social character.
This world. I do not praise desire,
This he believed: a kindred spirit
(This joking I used to protest),
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Though late, have a beginning made.(77)
(Though certainly mankind he knew
Though to the Academy I come
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Thy meditative incantation--
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
'Tis fearful to anticipate
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thrice happy who their agonies
Thus widely meditation erred,
Though scarcely following what was said,
Time was, the poet's tender quill
To anticipate the break of day,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
'Tis there that arrant fops display
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
To array himself in evening dress.
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To bear love's parching agonies--
To be a charming mystery:
To burn, yet reason keep awake
Though superannuated rather;
To clank the spur, delight the fair--
To dire contentment shall give birth
'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
They made him feel inclined to doze;
The youthful poet's fond confession.
They sat, but conversation's flow
They stir the heart as heretofore.
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
"The younger, you're in love with her!"
This anchorite amid his waste
This evanescent boyish bliss.
This great discovery relief
This, this were true felicity!
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Thou also, reader generous,
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Though I'll return to him right early,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Thus oft--this I myself confess--
To agitate me in my dreams.
Though by an error and unsought--
To flight before her radiant look,
To follow you in every place,
Though without palaces and streets,
Time was, a valiant general might
Time was, in style magniloquent
Time will the ravages efface--
To banish far unworthy themes
To find in gossip such delight,
To guess how you the eve pull through."--
To ask her name the trouble took.(76)
To fawn upon and love express;
To her an elegy composed.
To arid selfishness resigned,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
To male acquaintances he bows,
To look on life as on a show,
To mention the foregoing eve,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Took aim--but as immediately
To our Tattiana conquering,
To pass with reasonable men
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
To Russ indigenous are not;
To stay the maid against her will.
To strike imagination serve.
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To seek him out with bended head.
To the assembly her they bear.
To whom amongst the jealous throng
To understand by slow degrees
To whom we used to consecrate
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To sketch myself that I have tried
To write of any other elf
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Trembling he seeks the young princess--
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Through dense aristocratic rows
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus we began our little tale--
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Time was, the breath of early dawn
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
'Tis time to many her, 'tis true,
To all she answers cruelly--
Time was, two maidens from their home
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,(64)
Till proper rings could be procured.
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Tiresome unto her hath become
To an assembly--she appeared
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
To captivate her how devoted!
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Time without me will lessons give,
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
Titles and ages intermixed.
To classicism I've homage paid,
To God eternal hymns of praise.
Till morn--life uniform but gay,
To a surrender gave consent,
To be in conversation clear
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To consanguineous dinners they
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To dream upon the sunny strand
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
To foreign lands he would allude,
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
To happiness contributing.
Together moments one or two
To his Penates now returned,
To listen to the rippling rill.
"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To me he would his Olga give,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
To-morrow just like yesterday.
To-morrow before break of day,
To raise his pistol to his eye,
To the youth Eugene hurried now--
Trembles at artificial shame.
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
To dominate her worthy lord,
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
'Twas she who first within his breast
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
Two dressed in uniform appear--
Undressed herself and went to bed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Unfavourable unto her.
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unto a carping world must show--
Until her powers of running fail.
Unto Anicia for the keys
To visit Moscow in the season.
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Upon the table in a trice
Upon the windows tracery,
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Upon those margins she perceived
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Upon those pages she descries
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Vice in romance is glorified
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Villages in the distance show
Vows matrimonial to break,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Upon the opening page ye find:
"Warm yourself here a little space!"
Was a delightful little spot,
Was born beside the Neva, where
Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
Was certainly not erudite
Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Was withered ere the morning light--
Was wont with me at cards to play.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
To see his Olga ere the fray--
To slay himself with blade or ball,
To such--delightful to repel.
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the sarcastic observation,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To wander through the meadows still,
Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
To vary for a few brief days.
Transported to our Russian clime.
Unhappily too salt by far;
To write his forefathers to warn
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Until her heart less high should bound--
Until the sleepless Breguet chime
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Unknown to all, without a tie,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Unto her husband, went away--
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Unto their solitude one day,
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
Unto the sounding sea to list,
To what malicious merriment,
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
Upon her brow sits wrath alone--
Unto the gates the servants fly
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Unto the windmill he must ride
Upon my visions such intrude.
Upon the highway of the sea
Upon the meadows showering,
Upon its damp opacity,
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Us from the world wherein we live.
Unto the hero of this lay
Upon her cheek by adulation
Up to the attic, and all need
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Virgins miraculous I see,
Vladimir Lenski visited
"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Vladimir something curtly said
Vociferously paid her court,
Vladimir's property, a man
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Variety of speech and vests,
Waiting his coming--his alone!
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
Wallow, my friends, in company!
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Was with himself dissatisfied.
Was younger than myself, my light,
We all of us of education
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Was he in health and void of care?--
Was that which we are wont to call
Was the first question Olga made,
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
Was certainly no Grandison.
Wearied of leisure in the end,
We glide along a floor of wax.
We called to mind our youthful days--
We hear with interest intense
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Well! just as she was yesterday.
"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
Well! Larina appears to us
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
Well known unto Oneguine mine.
We must admit but little taste
We are the first who such a name
Were I like you a bard by trade--
"We never loved in days of old,
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Were to analysis subjected.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.
Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
Were you in love when you were young?"--
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
We visit about Christmas Day,
"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
What a storm of emotions keen
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What boots it with the age to strive?
"What can be drearier than the house,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
What agitation languidly
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known;
"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What, invitations? The same day
What is thy cleverness to me?
"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
What I by relatives conceive?
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What more's required? The world replies,
We Russians, friends from distant parts
"What can be done? She is no child!"
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,(80)
What is his latest character?
What never was remarked or heard
What say you? to the family--
When but a boy he Olga loved
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When in the study's calm retreat,
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The torment born of crime unseen,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
The young proprietor we find;
To Love all ages lowly bend,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
To accompany him and to escort
To this arrangement can be seen,
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
Upon his couch insensibly;
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To end with him her path below.
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
When I yon semicircle bright
When Passion's fire no longer glows
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
To Eve the universal mother,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
When poets lachrymose recite
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
When will the devil take his own!"
When, wise at length, we seek repose
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where long time he in solitude
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
With her they did associate,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Which is he? or an imitation,
Which of approaching labour tells
Which we experienced long ago.
With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
With mute appeal to ask they seem--
With our Oneguine doth aspire
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Who reads his visionary theme
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Without participation hears,
With quite a lachrymose expression
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Who had for four long years survived
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Who the romance do not complete,
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Will not five centuries exceed
Winter's approach she doth not hail
White Moscow raises her old spires,
With affectation,--nothing more.
With his exasperated sense,
With eye precise and without fail.
With it may be a couple more;
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
Without a chance to slip away.
With blessings on the ditches and
With scandal's trivial ornament.
Without them Eugene is complete;
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
With tears which secret sufferers love--
With such a perversity proclaim.
Would she in silence long remain.
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
What once I knew is clean forgot--
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What will the coming dawn reveal?
When all around the entrance pressed,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When deaf and silent he doth lie
What visions then her fancy thronged--
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
When motionless your gaze beneath
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
When the obedient doll in sport
When in as instant she is lost,--
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
When on the pallid eastern sky
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
Where all upon the surface lies,--
Where is he who doth not deceive?
When, where, and in what desert land,
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Where many another hand had signed
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Which might for many ages last.
Which in your spirit dominates,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Who by a haughty word or glance
Whither departed is the host?
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Who in the agony of grief
Who following Petrarch move along
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Who labours hard to humour us?
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within my memory I bore
What they in conversation said?--
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
Whene'er he had an aching head;
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
When in her walks abroad she met
When in the grand saloon was heard
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
When people with long countenance
When separation's hour drew nigh,
When, sitting by his fire alone
When shall I wing my passage free
When the hour came to bid good-bye--
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
When the mazurka used to peal,
Whene'er across the plain at speed
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When will my hour of freedom come!
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Where each young critic ready stands,
When the sonorous Breguet tells
Where every day before his eyes
Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
Wherefore regarding him express
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
When first upon my cheek I feel
Where fashionable circles meet
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where I can no more recollect?--
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Wherein we lately left the twain.
When he in ardent verse portrays
When in simplicity ye wrote
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Wherein I castigation get;
Wherein love innocently pines.
When in that company she saw
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Which never have existed, e'en
Wherein the miserable wife
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Whereto in language courteous
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst the tired serving-men without
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"--
Where the first time I saw your face,--
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Whither that evening he will go.
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
When the same life before him lies
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom latterly one often meets
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Which in the winter were a joy:
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Who early died a gallant death_,"
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Who now could fail to recognize
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
Whom thirty centuries adore.
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
Will happiness replace. My God!
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Who to surrender did not blench
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
Will sound an insult in your ear.
"Why did you leave last night so soon?"
Will he pursue?--But no one came.
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will to the old times faithful be.
Winter resigned her empire white,
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
With an imagination wild,
With cherries, red currants,
Why did you visit our poor place?
With dance and with song.
With fir-trees standing motionless
Within his memory there lay,
Within resounded shriek and shout:
With intellect and strong volition
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
With ardent sighs and flattery
With better half as cumbersome;
With bated breath, around she bends
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With hope and then perplexity,
With inexact pronunciation
With deeper woe than others' grief.
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Within its wave the sounding pail,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
Within her; she is sick at heart;
With laughter smothered weariness:
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With Olga; nor of this appeared
Without enthusiasm he met
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With little knowledge and that wrong
Without grammatical mistakes.
With Ozeroff was wont to share
Without profession, business, wife,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Within that secret court discussed,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
With great delight.--O God on high!
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
With many a snare their pathway line!
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
With one foot resting on its tip
Without disgust we look upon?
Without the faintest trace to leave
With raspberries, cherries.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With him were friends eternally:
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
With shame I shudder and with dread--
With spiritual tenderness;
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Without the ken of parents both,
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With so much warmth and intellect?
With taffety instead of crape.
With serious air then went away
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--
With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
With this immoderate request
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With thee I conversed when I bore
With tranquil air Oneguine leads
With the epistle of my fair;
With unanimity complete,
With tumult or contentment still
With us 'tis quite a novelty
With "vale" finish off a note;
Whom you in slumber may have seen."
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whose author nature understood
Whose heart experience icy made
Who without more prevarication
Who words and actions will adjust
Who would the maiden innocent
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
With gay design and silken stitch.
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
With Eugene pranks of former years
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With humble prose I'll fill my page
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
With measured step and even gait
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With us is easily attained.
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
"Who will be there?"--"The family.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With intellect, a taste refined,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With love which happiness extends;
With epigrams impertinent,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
With tenderness hath recognized
Without the least constraint he bowed.
With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Writ in my honour now and then--
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With its exhilarating flow,
With worldly honours, it may be,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Would haste in agitation dire
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
With words of foreign origin
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet I in idleness expend
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet suffering emotional
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Yes, happy--though she at his side
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife."
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
You fall in love again. But still--
You in the least commiserate
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Ye need dissimulation base
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet with a feigned frigidity
"You have a letter to me sent.
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
You'll spend your winter famously!
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
You never would have heard the name,
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
You never since your nose have shown.
You o'er your wine insulted hath--
Your conversation cold and hard,
"Your fashionable world I hate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Your magic voices I shall greet,
"Your second you have left behind!"
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Your innocent and charming note
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
You know that I am now a fool--
You will not all abandon me.
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
You with stern countenance declare
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
