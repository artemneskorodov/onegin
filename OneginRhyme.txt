Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Upon the highway of the sea
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Oneguine's Letter to Tattiana
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
And silent as the maid Svetlana
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
At last the author!" cries Mamma.
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Next Saturday. The Larina
Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
He found them in an almanac,
To seek him out with bended head.
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
The inmate is for ever dumb,
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
Each other as the shore we climb!
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
Whene'er he had an aching head;
But on the third of grove and mead
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Some are afar and some are dead.
Above the ashes of the dead.
For patience, reader, I must plead!
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
For on their brows I trembling read
And it may be a secret dread
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
And lessons to his children read.
Some nice instructive novel read,
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
His uncle, busy man indeed,
But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
With shame I shudder and with dread--
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
She could not sleep in her new bed.
For the impatient chief instead.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Grant that I err not on the road."
The friends are called and quickly placed.
Except one by the window placed
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
He on his bosom gently placed
Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
The two old ladies then embraced
Thither in future to proceed
He took no more the slightest heed;
Whene'er across the plain at speed
From the moist cork the bottle freed
Had run across her path at speed,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
And in society might shed
What visions then her fancy thronged--
A visionary mortified,
As if he cruelly had joked!
The troop of apparitions fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
By visions who was ne'er deranged
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
Verses and tears et cetera.
That certain volumes she might read.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Do not excuse yourself. I read
He long should have been on the road.
Still certain authors, I may add,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
Undressed herself and went to bed
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Will not five centuries exceed
Up to the attic, and all need
Whither and wherefore do I speed
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
Vice in romance is glorified
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
But now our minds are mystified
To sketch myself that I have tried
He conversation would have led--
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
The channel of the river stilled
He dragged her by a forest road
Was with himself dissatisfied.
But in his heart dissatisfied,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
By melancholy fogs concealed.
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
A gambling troop when he controlled,
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
Surely ye all have overhauled
And when the watery mirror gleamed
A few of different temper deemed,
Successfully to please her tried,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
That our desires which noblest seemed,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
And vows will probably be signed:
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Where many another hand had signed
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Caricatures he now designed
To arid selfishness resigned,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
The fruits of learning and combined
A tender couplet he combined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Tattiana more than ever burned
Certain misfortune near opined.
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
He on the conflagration frowned.(74)
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
At fifty who relief obtained
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
A valuable hostage gained,
And on the last one, underlined:
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A faithful model she appeared
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
To an assembly--she appeared
With Olga; nor of this appeared
For evermore had disappeared.
Asunder was and hate prepared?
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
His tea with rum no more desired,
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
When all around the entrance pressed,
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
By friendship how they were abused,
Within that secret court discussed,
A book at early morn perused.
Delusions of a mind untried,
By a rich pie were occupied--
He round the billiard-table stalked,
The princess from the sofa cried
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
And such unconsciously he led,
And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed_!--
But kindness from his eye had beamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her money counted, and designed
A bastard fame prohibited?
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Both natural and truthful seemed.
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The venerable dame opined
He went not--sooner was prepared
His ruffian bravery adored,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Who had for four long years survived
When but a boy he Olga loved
For first "madame" his wants observed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
With us is easily attained.
With intellect, a taste refined,
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
His visit she had not awaited,
Should go, the market for a maid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Fortune the poet had repaid.
With tenderness hath recognized
What they in conversation said?--
Adieu she to the matron said
With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
But finally she softly said:
Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
Her features no grimaces bleared;
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Their glory with their heels of red
To kiss the feet which I admired!
Contented and with victuals stored,
And both of dull existence tired,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
How like the billow I desired
And by a partial temper stirred
He who economy abhorred,
Thus widely meditation erred,
Till proper rings could be procured.
The shining pistols are uncased,
At first, but soon became inured
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
To her an elegy composed.
At times three words to him addressed
The style in which my hero dressed;
"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
Though some men, evilly disposed,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Though beauty he no more adored,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
At home arriving he addressed
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
The room my former master used.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
The maid whose note he still possessed
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
The hussar Pikhtin was accused.
And though her soul might be confused,
They long at home have her expected--
By Olga's hand distributed
Turned and replied as it behoved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And she at last hath us deceived;
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
They in a peaceful life preserved
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Eight rubbers were already played,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Change of position had essayed,
Tattiana every day conferred
He ought to have conciliated
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Were to analysis subjected.
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Vladimir Lenski visited
To captivate her how devoted!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Tattiana with impatience waited
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Upon those margins she perceived
He witnessed tenderly and moved
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
And as a country damsel roved,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Titles and ages intermixed.
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He with his little maiden played,
That we her constantly betrayed
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
The gifted songster never swerved,
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
And vehemently though amazed
The powder in the pan is laid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
To classicism I've homage paid,
Gazing into his face, she said:
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Had rendered him an invalid;
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Better than Chateaubriand did
As one who bivouacs afield,
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
A mien unaltered she preserved,
And necessary fools allowed.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Though scarcely following what was said,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
He found him on the table laid,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
Again imagination blazed,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
How empires store of wealth unfold,
The medium is required of gold.
The wolf upon the highways bold
Tattiana in traditions old
Had killed me had the like been told."
And the suspicious veteran old,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
Exist--that their immortal band
With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
The poet, modest though so grand,
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Her tears flow plentifully and
A passionate desire to bend
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Charms more enduring in the end.
Their natural attractions lend
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
Are admirable, my dear friend,
But what astonished do I find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
The wood she enters--bear behind,--
Had perished a creative mind,
A weary season was at hand--
However cherries might abound,
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
Vladimir something curtly said
"What can be done? She is no child!"
With an imagination wild,
What are they? Gladly would I yield
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
He took the room wherein the old
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
His mother from the door doth scold.
I also wandered there of old,
These evenings as in days of old
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
To Olga frequently he would
Her foot was in my other hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
The ruts of his own fatherland.
When, where, and in what desert land,
With blessings on the ditches and
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
All to the doctors Eugene send,
But finally in wedlock bind.
Upon the opening page ye find:
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
To dream upon the sunny strand
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
To Love all ages lowly bend,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
Become alarmed. So never mind!
His immorality of mind
So uncongenial to my mind,
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But one thought only filled his mind,
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Funeral amateurs abound!
Until her heart less high should bound--
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
A beau is for Tattiana found!
This monument of thought profound
The lancer, to his calling bound,
(This by command; for it was found,
Examined, mended, newly found
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Endless conjectures all propound
A tangled wilderness around.
The snows from off the hills around
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
"We never loved in days of old,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
The young proprietor we find;
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
From mere vacuity of mind
What jokes and guesses now abound,
And they the waters recommend.
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
But suddenly all changed around!
The Russian N with nasal sound
Will happiness replace. My God!
Attentive to the echoing sound,
As to a worthy man and good!
Such is the country custom good;
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
The river through the linden wood.
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
How I have erred and felt the rod!
But such is not for me. I brood
He was no more! The youthful bard
Her utterances ever heard,
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"--
What never was remarked or heard
Tattiana would have gladly heard
What doth she see? Around the board
When in the grand saloon was heard
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
The company deep silence guard.
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Sighs on another than her lord
To dominate her worthy lord,
Command him not to say a word--
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
As many entertainments be!
"Do not--you might--suspicious be;
His soul by crash of music fired,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
Opened the portals of the tomb
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
Or for the solitary tomb
And triumphs in career erotic.
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
All silently hung down his head.
And gently hovered o'er my head?
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
I slumber much, a little read,
A little farther please to read
But presently she tried to read;
And two old pines their branches spread--
I Apuleius gladly read
Nor slander viciously could spread
Although we know that Eugene had
No other book had time to read.
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
Attentive listened to the lad.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
And cares not farther to proceed;
An idle anchorite and sad,
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Just at that time his father died,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
My mother-in-law who lately died
I cannot longer wage concealed.
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
I was incensed and he was sad.
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
In coach or post-cart duly placed
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
My image hath not disappeared,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Rooted unto the spot remained.
"Enough, arise! for much we need
She consolation thence obtained--
Anticipating woe she pined,
Or even, silent and resigned,
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
I long by ballets have been bored,
Either she saw not or ignored;
As Saadi anciently averred--(86)
In love adventures she was versed,
If the poor maiden could have guessed
And kindness Tania was impressed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Retained the image, though short-lived,
At an old aunt's they had arrived
But Lenski, I should be so glad
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
And finally, upon his bed
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
All overtures of friendship ended.
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
She seeks the garden in her need--
Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
Most by this circumstance offended
And all with one accord agreed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Most carefully Zaretski placed
It may be that I did proceed--
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Alone she gallops on her steed,
But the date subsequently changed
A breathless silence then, prolonged--
And long perukes hath vanished.
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Lenski unto the dame replied,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
Love to idealize inclined;
At Larina's abode produced
As if with eider-down is filled.
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
On melted wax in water poured;
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
In fact, some people were assured
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
But proudly in his song preserved
Enraptured was he if allowed
Please her by their decorum fixed,
In company, or simply bowed,
And her upon the threshold laid.
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
Customs by ages sanctified,
And a new diadem supplied.
"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
"I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The matter by his conscience tried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
And a long time about her talked.
This life in masquerade concealed,
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
Is it that I am now compelled
Made revelations undesigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
Once more to idleness consigned,
O ye whom tender love hath pained
She never of deception dreamed
And saying this Vladimir drained
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A life of fact, not fiction, led--
And in her conversation drawled.
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
But since to the backdoor they led
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
Oneguine was--so many deemed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
Only her countenance assumed
That, for the century designed,
Before he eighteen years attained.
A modern Regulus unchained,
At first for books was disinclined,
Inseparable they remained.
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Into the cups already sped
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
And many another slily sneered;
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
The fated nutriment desired;
By indolence and languor fired
I write to you! Is more required?
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
In the recesses what hath stirred
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred;
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
A marriageable maid matured,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!"
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
The image of her seal impressed.
Lenski as a good match received,--
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Oneguine was the most impressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Some Russian authors he perused--
Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
In vain was youth by us received,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived(65)
In fact, the subject analysed,
And life and fate in turn selected
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Replaced them in their box, undressed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Already by repentance moved
The conversation was revived
And ancient usages observed
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Of what he thought and what believed,
In correspondence been allowed.
But from the interview what flowed?
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
The deuce with my inside has played."
The drama of my youth was played.
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
At prisoner's base she never played.
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
In amorous flights when so inspired,
So she in French herself expressed.
And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
For which the poet agonized
And many a day thereafter laid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
At early morn returns the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Nor frigid adulation paid.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Oneguine then approached and said:
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
In whispers low the neighbours said:
So be it! Just the laws which bid
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.(82)
In mist profound all yet is hid.
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
But cannot stand the northern cold.
And can it be? But late a child
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
An almanac but eight years old.
Some marriageable maids behold,
She promised Eugene, or she would
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
In one he doth accounts behold,
Of friends unceremonious would
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
A loaded pistol in his hand.
And in the bathroom did command
In times gone by thy bare command--"
November at the gate did stand.
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
To see you by our fireside stand,
Sickness more courage doth command
Assistance ever will extend,
Into the starry night extend.
Infallibly you there will find
Perchance to benefit mankind,
In dreams and what the moon foretold
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
If not, the money I will lend."
Yet I in idleness expend
Quick to the country let us wend
Of dreary Russia left behind,
In duel having killed his friend
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
It gradually possessed his mind;
"Your second you have left behind!"
Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
But gazes on Oneguine's face
Depicted on your haughty face!
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
The damsel under escort place.
One image occupied his mind,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Hard by the window took her place."--
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
A something somehow have obtained,
And handsome countenance combined,
And harmony was soon restored.
Of his approach; but nothing cared
An explanation: she was scared,
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
And every year distributed
Of the romances she preferred,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Another with cock's head appeared,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
She on the apparition gazed,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
And exclamations interlaced.
Returning, from his ship amid
Scornfully challenged you afield--
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
And had with waddling in the end
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
Then handed her the song with grace.
For there he left a mournful trace.
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
The shining river clothed in ice;
Behold! than polished floor more nice
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Euphonious, though I know a spice
And to the field of honour led;
And stoves of various shapes abound.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
And if Tattiana mine had found--
That I to you reveal my mind?
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Lo! in my garden was she found
And secretly their views expound.
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Imperial portraits hang around
And flooded all the level ground.
Selfish nonentities around?
Of horn in circle call them round.
If he had only known the wound
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
The German baker looks around
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Debate commanded ample food--
Lessons to give he understood!
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
A village and beneath, a wood,
Oneguine meditative stood,
Dark was the valley and the wood
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
And ought he not to disregard
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
Your conversation cold and hard,
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
A young and handsome galliard.
She enters a deserted yard--
Marmontel also, tome the third;
She deemed its outline might afford.
Together they returned, nor word
And never hath our language proud
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
That girl--but he must dreaming be--
But what a nuisance it will be,
Is still condemned in love to be;
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Inseparable soon they be.
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Reform me both in deed and word,
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Oneguine wasted; on my word,
No more the music thunders loud,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Of my light paramour was proud.
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Epistle second, note the third,
I would desire my bride to be--
With worldly honours, it may be,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Time will the ravages efface--
And this fifth canto ought to be
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
(One and the same thing it may be)
Pallid and melancholy face,
By "belle Tattiana" to replace.
To follow you in every place,
Or a swift meteor, may be,
"She who with melancholy face
I never should have seen your face
And after them at headlong pace
And physic bring with mournful face,
Oneguine--the beloved place
At the front gates, but in brief space
An ancient lady full of grace.--
A print without the picture's grace,
Inheritor of all his race.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Like his, her dress was always nice,
But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
And the extent of his caprice;
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Not all will like myself proceed--
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"
And with remorseful anguish filled,
Nought in the universe refused:
And not a speck of dirt descried.
Not that she had his works perused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
Nor long his mind was agitated
A new proprietor arrived,
Of London life is "vulgar" called
Now a long branch itself entwined
And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
And what she from the cards inferred.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
My sum of happiness contained;
Of censure for the same incurred;
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And numerous pages had preserved
And when her violence reviewed--
And these the attentive maid observed
And privileges nice allowed,
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
My pretty self-deceiving maid--
No time to pick it up! afraid,
And spectacles, his knitting staid
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And the young ladies fortunes told,
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of a strange night when the moon and--
And thou, persistent to the end,
My days of life approach their end,
Of all the guests within his mind.
A noted fop who gambled hard.
And the recesses of my mind
Of late I have been quite absurd,--
No more the village knows his face,
And who the rent-roll of his race
None the conviction could withstand
And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
And my Eugene the path must trace--
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
An ear to my confession lend;
No, ever to behold your face,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Before him her wild game of chance.
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
God grant that all who herein glance,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
I heard thy voice's resonance
He wanders in his indolence;
And views amongst themselves advance
To friendship making no pretence,
I, after so much eloquence,
His momentary loving glance
Such open-hearted innocence.
Tattiana learns the intelligence--
Canto the First of this romance.
And aimless journeys did commence--
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
Habit would bring indifference.
His energy and impotence.
Not to behave as he did once--
It may be that his martyred shade
And the newcomers welcome bade.
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
And yet oblivion forbade.
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
Seek the forgotten countenance
And his strange conduct at the dance
Meeting you in times past by chance,
The days of love and of romance!
Reviews both dress and countenance,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Then would we muse as in a trance,
And natural benevolence,
Then to reward such confidence
Oh! what had been his eminence!
And in her hand a French romance.
Or will my melancholy glance
But this adventure's consequence
In serious mood or dalliance
Of her provincial innocence
I yield with a low reverence;
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
The hero's name too in advance,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
As in a thicket's humble shade,
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
He whom we sing to shall be made
I was for calm existence made,
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though late, have a beginning made.(77)
Though the foul vision promise made
But sad is the reflection made,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
But no reply unto her made.
Nor further comment that night made.
A certain little escapade
They shovel silver with a spade,
Her amorous experience
The goddess would a masquerade
And what will Destiny concede?"
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
His fate shall presently decide.
She leisurely away doth ride,
But I am now another's bride--
"He promised here this day to ride,"
But cannot anyhow evade
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
On horseback every day they ride--
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
Mute glances interchanged aside
Suddenly to the left hand side,
But now all doubt was set aside,
And glittering simpletons beside;
And soon Oneguine's door beside
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
And hastened to his uncle's side,
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
And death before the husband wide
Of a most mournful episode,
Like Leonora did she ride(79)
And unto whom we all allude
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My scholar without aptitude
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Meet punishment for him provide.
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Found them in darkness side by side,
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
Perchance he will to all the three.
This lot in life with stern decree?
Tome of "Malvina," and but three
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
From such digressions wholly free.
The house and garden I would see."
The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
And a guitar produced we see,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
To move in fashionable life,
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
The letter is the thing, you see,--
"Olinka is her junior, see.
And leads a solitary life?
Of error and the passions' strife.
And like his shadow dogged his life,
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
Or better,--like a faithful wife.
So be it! But internal strife
And testy gamesters do engage
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Or in a squabble to engage,
As once, to fill the rapid page
A visionary personage
But grown familiar side by side
A pair of bullets--nought beside--
Know that thy face that day I see.
Or faults of grammar on its page--
As storms which in chill autumn rage
As the reflection of his age,
Saint Priest, who every album's page
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Placed at the customary range;
Jaws are at work. On every side
The traveller, bird of passage he,
A paragon of virtue he!
He knew not how to spend his life.
And by a sweet delusion he
And in her native language she
"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And a half rubles down gave she;
She sits alone--'tis ever _she_!
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
And an encouragement did breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
Men love no more, as only the
On Sundays by yon window he,
Before you agonized to die--
And silently I here must die--
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
E'en as the presence of a snake,
He deemed his friends but longed to make
My sportive Muse I used to take
Her promptings unto law did make,
And every morning I awake
And disappear in space; then she
Pedantic although scholar like,
"The post hath kept him, it is like."
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
And barely visible the smoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
Or any trifle else ye like
Nor the frost particles inhale
And Lenski followed--a light broke--
Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
I tried when I began this tale,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
I the same admonition make.
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Espying, Eugene with a smile
They crack a feeble joke and smile--
The Russian language I deem vile
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Shall my declining years beguile;
Preserves and an eternal prattle
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Avenge himself in proper style.
And a romance in ancient style
Of the horizon she is like!"--
Fashion is there immutable,
The door flew open--Olga came,
"And is it long since back he came?
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Athwart the snow four paces came--
And comfort of each country dame,
Believe me, of my present shame
And straight returning whence he came,
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
More blooming than the Boreal flame
But fashionable hatred's flame
And in addition youth is flame
To part in amity with thee!
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
Before whom once in solitude,
Always together, eventide
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Tender and elevated, free?
In worldly din or solitude
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
He usually was glad to see
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
Measured with great exactitude.
By Providence's dark decree!
A mansion--by the window, see!
He in the early years of life
The giddy world at last shall see.
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
Another could her heart engage,
By every proper-minded wife,
That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
But at a later, sterile age,
Another could her woe assuage
No one the contrary will urge,
By children and by faithful wife
But sweeter still it is to arrange
That girl whom once on a time he
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Tania well nigh expired when he
Nor on the letter yet hath she
All are amazed; but Lenski he
The family of children hie.
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
No fond illusions live to soothe,
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
The fever of the blood to slake--
By computation) it is like
To burn, yet reason keep awake
The comrade of your youth should strike,
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Then suddenly discharge a joke
In their sterility of prattle,
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Though correspondence as a rule
From Gottingen inspired he came,
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The break of day she doth not see,
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
Already sings the nightingale.
Honour and pride inflexible.
The crystals of her vestibule
But now in her effulgence pale
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
That afterwards with evil smile
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Cannot they amicably smile
But he desired not to beguile
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Because a member I became.
I owe the censorship a little.
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
As rosy lips without a smile,
Of touching lightly every theme.
He with an innocence extreme
And, inspiration firing me,
But will not modify a tittle--
On sunny days the glistening rime,
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Her figure perfect grows with time!
It now to investigate is time,
Though to the Academy I come
He wakes--they with a letter come--
Hateful the hollow world became,
And so Tattiana was her name,
And fled afar--she followed me.
At eventide would hither come,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
Long, long the hour had past when home
Pictures of the amusing scene,
The Princess N. will be at home
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
Oft staring through the window pane
The village wherein yawned Eugene
And so departed. But Eugene,
No longer through her former home;
Mournful is thine approach to me,
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
Open the window--sit by me."
But I--what is all this to me?
Of the domains of the side-scene.
"My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
As a poetic life serene,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
A single being: 'twas in fine
And make a dark existence shine
In solid, unpretentious style,
For our amusement ever made
Choosing a profitable trade,
For ever faithful will abide."
If thou wert sitting by my side,
And the saloon threw open wide;
In consultation stand aside--
Deep in the distant province rude,
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Then, then--well, in some solitude
Daily of love in solitude.
Secure in rural quietude--
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Displayed a noble rectitude--
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Since Eugene in that solitude
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
In many things had changed his life--
Should be respected throughout life
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In boston and the game of age,
Impressed him in the least degree,--
And rest from bygone days of strife.
Sterner solicitudes engage,
For two whole days it seemed a change
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
Dressed like a London dandy he
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
The bridge and alley to the lake,
For law I _far niente_ take
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
I know there's none more amiable.
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
How artless was the note which spoke
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Careless of every social rule,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
Nor by her beauty she became
And my romance's open theme
Tattiana faltered, and became
And then the stanzas of my theme
Nor shall the caterpillar come
A shape half cat and half a crane.
No other than Oneguine mine.
His valet brings him letters three.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Commence a new career in life
Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Never upon my heroine
Lest the world or her lord divine
Another bard with art divine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Of my impassioned heroine.
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Moina recalls for this alone
And in the frosty night alone
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
No answer all that day was borne.
Of fashionable dames the foe,
I cannot tell on what pretence--
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
But turn we once more to our dame.
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
By recklessness amuse or shame
He kindled his poetic flame.
Is it that ardent souls of flame
By love's inevitable flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
She is an angel! We sometime
That vicious set whom I don't blame--
She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
Descends the bank with care extreme,
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Despair and anger seize on me,
Callous to all on earth become--
And shorter had the days become.
Straight from their province had he come?"--
All dark and silent hath become;
I am in love, my hour hath come!
In winter time would often come.
In the lone garden and the lane?
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"
The bard his answer waits at home,
Undeviating and insane
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Such were the musings of Eugene.
All this was novel to Eugene.
She rose--departed. But Eugene
"And is it," meditates Eugene.
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Of many an economic scheme;
And visit many a foreign clime,
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
For a protracted space of time.
How in the country pass this time?
And may fall headlong any time.
His character attracted me.
To take a hand at whist oft come:
His name: the tenderness of home
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
Homeward returning, he at home
Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
But shall depict the touching scene
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
He was in error; for Eugene
The olden time shall be my theme.
Between myself and my Eugene,
"Departed Lenski here to dine
Behold the dames who once were fine
The sneers of critics superfine;
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--
The lamps illuminating shine;
He could in disputation shine
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"
And irrigate them with champagne;
Do all things which to mirth incline.
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
"Aline!"
Diminishes as years decline.
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Corset and album and Pauline,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
In your young days and also mine),
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
Is it for long?"--"Ma chere cousine!"
Before the dregs they shall divine
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
The sum of my existence gone
Can she have been a moment gone
To pass the night at home hath gone.
That hero, though his merit shone,
'Twas these he read and these alone
Dreaming herself the heroine
Certainly not Eugene alone
To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
All to the grand saloon are gone--
Tattiana's Letter to Oneguine
Give me just half a glass of wine--
The ball in all its splendour shone.
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
In horror for itself alone,
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
That mediocrity alone
She murmurs in an undertone
Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
Though around honoured Priam's throne
That all may hear his voice's tone.
That like a friendly voice its tone
But that the eyes of every one
The aged woman in her woe:
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Or quietly partake our woe.
Could in romantic mantle drape
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
Had bid her sigh for without hope--
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
In country solitude you mope,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
For a fictitious misanthrope,
Said something in an undertone
His inner consciousness laid bare,
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Having for money's sake alone
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
Forgotten in the village lone,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Now I am fit for nothing here.
I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
Lenski at intervals would dare,
O Men, how very like ye are
The vile seducer shall not dare
And impiously should declare,
I cannot help it I declare,
None could her beautiful declare,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
The riot of the world and glare
The crash of music, candles' glare
Here I remark all poets are
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
And the more surely we ensnare
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
   "He's here! Eugene is here!
(I speak not of our poems here),
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
Tattiana gently led them there.
And yet the city's flower was there,
He bends his course to Talon's, where
And lo! he is already there!
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Faces which we meet everywhere
Just as he entered. How severe!
If the choice in my power were,
And be not in advance severe.
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And Eugene soon discovered there
As if impossible it were
And spouted it with lyric fire--
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,--
The proud ones are not worth the fire
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
For our Automedons are fire
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
And that no longer could inspire.
Olga with trepidation dire.
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
He deemed his coming would inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Their privileged allurements fire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
All that a poet could desire,
All that perfection could desire;
This world. I do not praise desire,
So ardently did I desire
But Lenski, having no desire
He felt the laudable desire
At a great feast against desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
The Russian winter did adore
And the young girl appeared before
And homeward like an arrow tore.
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
And our swift troikas never tire;
He read as vainly as before,
He was deceived. Just as before
To help her to the other shore
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
They stir the heart as heretofore.
Society renounced once more.
As if against obstruction sore
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
"But which, my dear?--In days of yore
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
For long--for ever. To be sure
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
That my dishonour would ensure
Happy who timely grew mature,
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
He will delight you, I am sure,
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,--
That a friend's arm in every case
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
Possession hath no power to please,
In motley and amusing chase.
Of modern Russians the disease.
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
Napoleon tarried till it please
The curs away to kennel chase,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
She mourned and to the moon would raise
Of passion they so often raise.
Away! and cease to ring their praise
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
He has returned, say in what guise?
A very troublesome disease,
I say without poetic phrase,
Handbook of fashionable phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
From careless stanzas such as these,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
And would by candlelight arise.
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
He is a charming youth and wise.
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
Olga began to long likewise
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
Man--forty years long in this wise--
But now a question in this wise
Pervaded with much common sense.
The wit of others to acquire.
Opened with care, and entering bore
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
My spirit with such pangs before.
How oft to the Crimean shore
As bees who leave their dainty store
Away her golden earrings tore;
Endowing us from out her store
And thy protection I implore.
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
But competition I abjure
For who imposture can endure,
Serious endeavours to assure
They growl a bit--they scandalise--
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Olga the tea must supervise--
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Not even a poetic phrase,
If seriously he hath disease;
Eugene would speak regarding these.
She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Miraculously fair arise,
Of the night sentinels arise
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
And in her languid bosom raise
As cyphers others to appraise,
The Larinas were since sunrise
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense;
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Malignant fury they disclose,
"Command me, darling, what you choose"
The windows whitened, shutters close--
But nowhere can she find repose,
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
And where at last his bones repose
Do agitate his late repose.
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Are turned upon her. All combine
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
Where the first time I saw your face,--
Why did you visit our poor place?
"Warm yourself here a little space!"
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
What acrimonious scorn I trace
Again in her ethereal dance?
When people with long countenance
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
Upon the table in a trice
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Who by a haughty word or glance
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Was the first question Olga made,
"Advance!"--
Were I like you a bard by trade--
Unto the windmill he must ride
Whose heart experience icy made
A bearded postillion astride
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
Yes, happy--though she at his side
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
To foreign lands he would allude,
Where long time he in solitude
Yet sometimes pages two or three
You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife."
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Again a century should scourge
Virgins miraculous I see,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
Trembles at artificial shame.
We are the first who such a name
A dying man with art to soothe,
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Three mortal hours per diem he
Unknown to all, without a tie,
Thus we began our little tale--
Wherein the miserable wife
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,(64)
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
About the rain and flax and cattle."--
When shall I wing my passage free
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
You never would have heard the name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Who floats contentedly through life,
Will he pursue?--But no one came.
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Who reads his visionary theme
Until the sleepless Breguet chime
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Transported to our Russian clime.
You will not all abandon me.
Across her youth a shade had come,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
Tiresome unto her hath become
When will my hour of freedom come!
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Without profession, business, wife,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Time was, two maidens from their home
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
With humble prose I'll fill my page
With better half as cumbersome;
What is thy cleverness to me?
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Well known unto Oneguine mine.
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
When, sitting by his fire alone
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
With many a snare their pathway line!
A constant harping on one tune,
With taffety instead of crape.
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
Which in the elevated sphere
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Would haste in agitation dire
With all their progeny were there,
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
With our Oneguine doth aspire
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
With thee I conversed when I bore
You with stern countenance declare
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Upon her brow sits wrath alone--
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
Was he in health and void of care?--
Albums magnificent which scare
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Was born beside the Neva, where
With Ozeroff was wont to share
Yet still apparently aspire
A hidden train of wild desire.
Waiting his coming--his alone!
Within my memory I bore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
With affectation,--nothing more.
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
A gust of passion never tore
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
Whom thirty centuries adore.
A fragile bridge and insecure,
And after Albion's proud lyre
Ye need dissimulation base
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With it may be a couple more;
To God eternal hymns of praise.
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
We hear with interest intense
And the conviction soon arose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
That for that matter in my verse
And also that my feeble verse--
At womankind he growled a curse,
In age the memory gets worse,
Existence would not make a curse,
I once forgot for your sweet cause
All visited him at first, of course;
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
Now I am ready to refuse.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
But look you--ah! do not refuse."
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
The monsters of the British Muse
A mournful temper on his Muse.
But I must now employ my Muse
Incited by his stormy Muse
One instrument for his own use--
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
"What can be drearier than the house,
"Abandon hope for ever here!"
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A curious interest disclose
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
Who every gesture, every phrase
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Furious he from the table rose;
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Detecting him the passing horse
With his exasperated sense,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Where melancholy rocks arise
A dinner, whimsical each course,
snorts, and his rider bends his course
I lift a warning voice because
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
But I the products of my Muse,
Of friends the grateful intercourse--
Now for the first time I my Muse
Whose memory doth not refuse
Received him freely at her house,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
I would your vigilance arouse,
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Address to you one single phrase
The drum already doth arouse.
But what results? His eyes peruse
They would not solemnly debate
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
They long ago had held debate.
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
But Olga would not such peruse.
I married--now, I supplicate--
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
          Indifferent and sedate,
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
(Like other things I could relate)
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A promenade in twilight late
The world enough. Congratulate
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Just at the hour we designate
You in the least commiserate
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
My soul I cannot renovate--
And irritates the appetite.
And an elegiac poem wrote.
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Another time, so willed it Fate,
The servants used to congregate
Indifferent was her future fate.
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
With her they did associate,
"He hath neglected us of late."--
The time for mystic strolls which late
How soon he learnt to titillate
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
Both were expectant of the hate
"Your fashionable world I hate,
Both were of passion satiate
But if the truth I must relate,
Sometime collected, shall relate
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
Desirous to annihilate
But round the hostess scintillate
Excruciate the heart and late
Conscious of death approximate,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And stupid censors passionate;
But I came not to adulate:
But if my lot unfortunate
Her manners were deliberate,
But merely to exasperate;
In charming fashion mutilate?
Perchance one more affectionate.
Must be pronounced unfortunate--
His double sashes and his grate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
That year the autumn season late
But now my mind is desolate,
Two hearts perchance were desolate
A mild quotation to translate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Longtime was her heart desolate
And jests doth recapitulate.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
By time (who can anticipate?)
For evermore is separate.
'Tis fearful to anticipate
I had found my predestinate,
The Larinas would celebrate,
And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
To whom we used to consecrate
Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
Spoiled children most degenerate
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
I am not strong enough to state;
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
I have endured without respite.
Serve who could neither read nor write.
But I must add to what I write
So let us to the ball-room haste,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:
With jealous fire resuscitate,
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
The matter did not agitate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
The sorrows of a single state.
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
By rank as settled by the State.
"Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
My heart of old would captivate.
In bud of promise incomplete,
These take their seats; the coach of state
Around my stanzas incomplete
The weary way still incomplete,
Without them Eugene is complete;
Who the romance do not complete,
When poets lachrymose recite
With unanimity complete,
Was certainly not erudite
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
A bottle of a vintage white
Encountered punishment complete,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Its ebullition foaming white
All so distinct, and all so white!
The fervid poet would recite,
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
A philosophic anchorite:
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
Winter resigned her empire white,
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
But now our hero we must leave
Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
But where Melpomene doth rave
Happy who thereto can unite
The girl in marriage they unite.
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Or the delivery of a note.
By Olga stood, dejected quite
Fond declarations they invite
Affection how did you requite?
For I myself was thirteen quite;
And town and friends forgotten quite.
Interrogation to denote.
To purest love he tuned his note
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Highways all Russia will unite
Nor even tears afford respite,
The vestibule finds empty quite--
A Russian household simple quite,
On innocent delights I dote,
I on my chosen hero dote;
We must admit but little taste
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Lenski his comrade did invite.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
And education runs to waste,
Device of rural minds acute!)
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
No novelty--is it not true?--
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
Thou also, my ideal true,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
But my Oneguine the whole eve
And her bespangled robe doth wave
These are your relatives, believe:
Just at a moment which I grieve
To shallow sentiment a slave!
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
And that too often we receive
The most industrious man alive
Depart in peace and friendly live?
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
And enmity and hope and love--
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
A thick immense neglected grove
Gently for pranks he would reprove
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
And long her eyes as through a haze
No, never in the early blaze
From whose analysis minute
"Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
He sang of love--to love a slave.
What I by relatives conceive?
The Lord deliver her and save!
My heart with but one look revive;
A first success light pinions gave,
And thy inebriating wave
Applause, the people's donative.
What boots it with the age to strive?
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
He called upon me Christmas Eve--
To swagger as the art of love,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
And supper. In the country we
The fatal secrets of the grave,
On everything around her gaze,
"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
The hero we immortalize.
Who now could fail to recognize
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
To standards in which we believe?
With tears which secret sufferers love--
By absence who hath chilled his love,
The cynosure of every eye.
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Having lost all in life we prize.
Is ever ready with relief,
Habit alleviates the grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
The family of Kharlikoff,
Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
On balls I madly used to dote,
With "vale" finish off a note;
Your innocent and charming note
A dagger, asterisk, or note
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
When in simplicity ye wrote
And the attendants called in haste.
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
All which in Paris eager taste,
More satisfaction to her taste.
This anchorite amid his waste
Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
And the cast-iron statuette
In the beginning, cold and mute,
And she despite herself would waste
None could a trace of that impute,
My country's honour and repute
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Her all in all did constitute;
Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
Latin is just now not in vogue,
His vanity first let us pique
Ah! it may be, affection true
For ever your Tattiana leave.
I did not please you. Why pursue
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Into delicious bondage gave
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
And all without her husband's leave.
Alarm the winter journey gave.
The prejudices all men have,
A prudent man like you and brave
For him an honourable grave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
My guardian angel to the grave.
The moderns of the ancients rave--
Where is he who doth not deceive?
To jest as he had done last eve,
"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
To me he would his Olga give,
Time without me will lessons give,
To write in cantos twenty-five.
Us from the world wherein we live.
And yet he in your cause would strive
Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
So meantime let him joyous live
There our Katenine did revive
But I await thee: scarce alive
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Again the plague of boyhood--love?
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
And loves you as--a relative!
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
The malady of hopeless love
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Desire to rule ye may observe
Around the meadow and the grove.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
If Olga smilingly approve,
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
With footsteps tremulous with awe
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Nor the first snow of winter seize
And ease and fashionable waste,--
He racked his brains to find its clue
Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
And blest me, sinking to the grave.(78)
Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
Without the faintest trace to leave
Not the young timid maid, believe,
To mention the foregoing eve,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
I love you--to what end deceive?--
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
In clouds of steam above perceive.
That guests approach: and when above
I love you with a brother's love,
Maidens before her meekly move
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Striking the intellect with awe
When the hour came to bid good-bye--
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
And reads with rapid eager eye
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
But promise of our meeting gave,
His son is married, just conceive!"
I can't translate the adjective.(83)
Along the hall, and high above
The all-entrancing joys of love--
Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
To strike imagination serve.
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
To raise his pistol to his eye,
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Mutual destruction to contrive.
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
The calm existence which I prize
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Him a disquietude did seize,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
They made him feel inclined to doze;
And who is not a tiresome thief?
This great discovery relief
With deeper woe than others' grief.
Than one's own fascinating self.
Even beneath her parents' roof
Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
Espy him approaching,
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
But she, her sister never heeding,
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
But stop! I will present thee, if
Basins and jugs--well! everything
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
To write of any other elf
Also one Viazemski, remarking
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
Who in the agony of grief
However, Tania's letter reading,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But why are your cheeks whitening?"
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
The world is ever altering!
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
Or, parable more flattering,
Amidst successes flattering
To our Tattiana conquering,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!"
Upon the meadows showering,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
In life domestic see a string
That I forget not whom I sing.
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Behold! orthography despising,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--
At last my father gave his blessing,
Then dressed himself...
The language of her girlish pleading
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Some other long-departed Spring,
And an old gent the poet marking
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Follow up love--a secret meeting
To happiness contributing.
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
'Tis time to many her, 'tis true,
Page after page continued reading,
And honestly 'tis my belief
Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
Our union would produce but grief.
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Metreless verses recognizing
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
Existence calmly sped along,
Who following Petrarch move along
The days which to your youth belong?
Glittered in a perspective long,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
Terpsichore alone among
She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
And wild festivities among
But send your grandson before long."
He quits the fashionable throng
With little knowledge and that wrong
Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
She brought with her the gift of song.
To whom amongst the jealous throng
I formerly admired her much
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
And grant success to labour long;
He thought to write, but labour long
The lively trash of stories long
The nightingale there all night long,
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
And thus he never fell among
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
Either with him or thee in song,
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Let me explain that in my song
Since I beheld Eugene and young
The Maidens' Song
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The tiny sun shone less on high
Heaved an involuntary sigh
He lies, upon his forehead death,
And oft at eventide a throng
And led me off to church with song."
A double force unto their song
With dance and with song.
Were you in love when you were young?"--
"I celebrate a comrade young
Or letters of a maiden young.
Enough! my pack is now unslung--
Happy he who in youth was young,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
His harp beneath that sky had rung
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
He who life's frosts which early wrung
Make up your mind to go there."--"Ah!
The native Russian tongue impeach?
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
For Moscow fops and Circes each
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Alas! with merited reproach.
How meekly then I heard you preach--
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Did not their lips with foreign speech
But ultimately doth approach.
Attentive listened to his speech,
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
And many a caravan on high
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Many an ancient legend which
No coquetry was there, I vouch--
And from the misty woodland nigh
Sails her allotted course on high,
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Who to surrender did not blench
But home his body to despatch
With gay design and silken stitch.
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
They sent their compliments--but oh!
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
My doom has been pronounced on high,
To guess how you the eve pull through."--
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Above the humble urn of death.
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Or even overcome by wrath
"I call to witness God on high--"
With great delight.--O God on high!
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
When separation's hour drew nigh,
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But finally she heaves a sigh,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Society endures not such!
There is no wreath upon the bough:
How dark the night is getting though!
His breast was riddled through and through,
In scenes like these it may be though,
And the eternal lorgnette through
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
When motionless your gaze beneath
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
And what the old man might bequeath.
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Who early died a gallant death_,"
Or counting on his uncle's death
"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
You o'er your wine insulted hath--
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Without the ken of parents both,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,(80)
I must resign myself, in sooth;
The dusty chronicles of earth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
To dire contentment shall give birth
But memory like a serpent's tooth
He salutary rules poured forth?
"Drive on!" the cheerful cry goes forth,
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
By the fine silver of the north.
The last poor obol I was worth--
Restrained the impulses of youth;
To the impressions of our youth,
Found the ideal of my youth,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
My frivolous and jolly youth.
But were it not immoral I
"My darling, growing old am I!
Imagine! Here alone am I!
My word of honour given have I.
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
In that morass where you and I
Another! to none other I
But with her elder sister I
But who abandon it--as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Her sisterhood delights the young
Careless of fame his spirit high
"Not in the least, assured am I!"
(Surely you know him as I speak);
His wadded coat and cap with peak
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
To listen to the words you speak,
In former years thus did not I
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
Bruin is marching at her back!
Passes the torrent But alack!
And the sagacious Triquet back
In truth he had the happy trick
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
And he had made her heart beat quick!
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Vows matrimonial to break,
And thus secures the prey we seek.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
The artful prisoner should seek
Incessantly his chains to break."
At times, if only once a week,
She sank.--
Vladimir closes up his book,
Himself transformed into a hack;
And then a cup of coffee drank,
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
But somehow there shone in his look
Caught him and by the collar took
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Till absently Vladimir took
They have invited you this week."
How thoroughly her part she took!
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,(66)
My venerated reader, oh!
A door he opens. But why shrank
He's a freemason, so we think.
How bright and tender was his look,
The little solitary nook
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
And shut him in a lonely nook.
Calling to mind your icy look
And flowed harmoniously. He took
To ask her name the trouble took.(76)
An honourable course ye took,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
And female tears hysterical,
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Economy political,
Assemblies oligarchical
And cannot anything conceal,
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
An oval countenance and pink,
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
To flight before her radiant look,
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
His course unto the running brook.
And clad in airy costume took
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
They deem her somewhat finical,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What will the coming dawn reveal?
Already he grew phthisical.
And with gray hair ambrosial
For promises her feet reveal
Outlandish and provincial,
Nought of its charms original
When the mazurka used to peal,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Lo! with what pride celestial
Yet suffering emotional
He deemed of human life the goal
The path which leads to glory's goal.
When first upon my cheek I feel
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
In one thing really did excel.
Though of romance therein I fail
With eye precise and without fail.
Winter's approach she doth not hail
Was that which we are wont to call
Behind her a grave general.
And others rise ephemeral!
The eyes of a grave general.
So, when he came next day to call,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
She soon forgot, began to call
On him spleen mounted sentinel
A ball in Peter's capital,
To such--delightful to repel.
The sharp incisions of his nail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
God grant I meet not at a ball
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Until her powers of running fail.
In time I'll give ye without fail
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Another tribune of the ball
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Bedding is laid out and to all
A true account and in detail.
A whisper runs along the hall,
Crush and confusion in the hall,
The snow descends and buries all,
The rigour of cold pride and all
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Long in this fashionable cell
Repentance wields not now her spell
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
A fop, in dress pedantical.
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
Nor years of separation all
A white and undulating pall
Her sentimental verses all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
Morality taught scarce at all;
He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
They shout and no one lists at all.
I envied sore the billows tall,
The lady's glance upon him fell--
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
Indifferent he became to all,
Of languor and of love did tell
Are all your relatives quite well?
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
The steward sent a note to tell
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Ennui can in the country dwell
And think: here lies who loved me well,
At thirty who was married well,
And wished to say to him farewell.
To take this letter to O-- Well!
"The family are all quite well--
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
And gallicisms I love as well
His relative and friend as well.
And sometimes into snares as well
For him were but of little worth,
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
For long he had endured them all.
Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
Some future ignoramus shall
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
For consecrate to me he fell
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
"I am in love," her whispers tell
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
I have no leisure here to dwell,
Hung like a print against the wall,
This separated us as well--
How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
"My heart's delight, thou art not well."--
Your heart possesses, I know well,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
Oneguine acted very well
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Proceeds, until she from a hill
My unpretending page shall fill,
The pervert world with icy chill
Let us proceed unto a rill,
His heart reciprocated still
And wisely gallops to the hill.
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
To listen to the rippling rill.
"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
An hour passed by--another--till,
The coach before a house stood still.
"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
A garden by a shining rill.
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Domestic life attracts me still,
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
To wander through the meadows still,
With tumult or contentment still
You fall in love again. But still--
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Time was, the poet's tender quill
Thus a guest with composure will
(See the first canto if ye will),
To stay the maid against her will.
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Perchance they laurels also cull--
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Rings from a dish of water full
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
You know that I am now a fool--
He used to hate--and was no fool--
Conventionality's dull tool--
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
He was a dear delightful fool--
And Eugene ever in her soul
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Of your perfections in my soul,
In order due the maidens pull;
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Learn to possess more self-control.
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
And a boy handed round the cream.
At eighteen not to play the fool!
"Monsieur l'Abbe," a starving Gaul,
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
But Tania just as in a dream
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
The story of his young love's dream,
Eugene at first began to dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
Tattiana in a misty dream,
All this may be an empty dream,
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
And a malicious epigram
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
And love's delicious diadem
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Of priceless value all things seem
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
And leans upon the monster's arm,
Distinctly not its mechanism.
Indeed, by force of magnetism
Jealousy and vexation took
'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Merciful God, what will he deem?"
A wish from place to place to roam,
Providence otherwise may deem--
He hath acquired the world's esteem
In three weeks would arrive for them;
With mute appeal to ask they seem--
With such a perversity proclaim.
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Is ever ready to proclaim
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,(84)
In winter by its blank and dim
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
And the lime alley's twilight dim
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
From first to last page to the rim.
Its driver seated on the rim
A country damsel's album trim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
"Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
She waited for--I don't know whom!
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
He sang of separation grim,
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
In some a willing martyrdom.
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
This is my master's sitting-room.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
The forests in mysterious gloom
"Had he been long here, and where from?
Back to his regiment must roam.
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
But could not. Then she questioned him:--
She nerves herself from her alarm
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
Fantastic images shall swarm
'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,
Laid down his life of sun and storm
A Russian poem's mechanism
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
How like a poet was my chum
He had excepted from the ban:
He "Benedetta" used to hum,
And my Tattiana now began
Zaretski, village mechanician,
At last became a ruined man.
I feel, allotted is my span;
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
In her friends' albums, time had been,
But, as he never opened them,
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
Oneguine slowly then began
Romances three, in which ye scan
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
He was an honest gentleman,
Eugene directs the trusty man
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
"How came you then to wed a man?"--
Portrayed contemporary man
Four deadly paces do they span;
Deep into debt his father ran;
Let me present ye to the man,
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Vladimir's property, a man
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
Portray the solitary den
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
There friends of pure delight had been
Had a deluded victim been
A fond and careful mother been.
The butt of scandal having been,
And fields my joys have ever been;
Which never have existed, e'en
"Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Assuredly should not have been
What a storm of emotions keen
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
Obedient she had ever been
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Was nothing but the British spleen
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
As your light footprints on the green.
The lonely mansion-house to screen
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
In springtime on the meadows green,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Become a faithful wife and e'en
Approach not to hearken
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Thine honour is my countersign!
Listen to me without disdain.
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
By an avowal just as plain.
To crush me with a just disdain.
To this arrangement can be seen,
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Whom you in slumber may have seen."
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
Amid submissive herds of men
The torment born of crime unseen,
So inaccessible to men,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"--
But nothing changed in them is seen,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
In little maidens of thirteen?
Having abjured the haunts of men,
His malady, whose cause I ween
The imagination to enliven
Writ in my honour now and then--
All bustle when he makes a sign:
Landscapes thereon he would design,
But boldly I myself resign:
My heart's allegiance can resign,
Men opposite. The cross they sign
My gratitude do not disdain,
But to the garden once again
A maid hath oft, may yet again
And agitate my heart again;
He there is master--that is plain;
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Can lower depths beyond remain?
As deaf and silly doth remain,
"My darling child, thou art in pain.--
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
After the wedded couple strain;
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,(71)
The household property contain:
My light productions to retain,
His daughter's book to ascertain
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Although her book did not contain
He reads at random, reads in vain.
To raise a clamour and a din:
But by degrees the crowd begin
At morn an icy bath within
Ere conversation could begin,
He heard his soul's complaint within,
Still everywhere, without, within,
Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
From gales a hill behind was seen;
"Oneguine, I was younger then,
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The tale of these romantic men;
And isolated from all men,
The poet fell; already men
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Another his betrothed was given;
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Yawning betook him to a pen.
The memory of the bard was driven
How deftly could he transport feign!
An exile from their troublous reign,
How bitterly he would malign,
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
To pass with reasonable men
I know that Parny's tender pen
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
By sympathy I have been driven.
Oneguine was a citizen
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Should dearly like a dance again.
Whom, as the custom is of men,
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Shall I behold thee once again?"--
The youthful lover once again
Oneguine, bored to death again,
Oneguine--take him up again--
That until Christmas comes again
Or if he meant to flirt again,
It wakens in my breast again.
Tattiana courage doth regain
Of love again, and yet again;
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
Behold! the world's opinion!
The torrent of opinion,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
Who without more prevarication
Enhances love in estimation
The idols of their adoration
Without constraint in conversation
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Without disgust we look upon?
Fresh aspirations I have known,
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
With inexact pronunciation
The fair of the next generation,
What everybody long has known;
Long time her young imagination
When will the devil take his own!"
Which we experienced long ago.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
His friendship I acquired just then;
By whom the youthful bard was slain?"--
Who selfishly unmoved remain
He obstinately will remain,
But, that life longer may remain,
Me now, inflict upon me pain?--
And an habitual sense of pain;
I know not if his heart felt pain
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Detest him for a brother slain?
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
And gave himself but little pain
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
The dream left terror in its train.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.(81)
Tania the meaning would obtain
A case of books he doth obtain--
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Would she in silence long remain.
I loved you--what did I obtain?
And distance interposed in vain,
And far removed from rumour vain;
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
I've wasted in amusements vain,
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
The converse of our hermits twain,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
In solitude or worldly din,
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
With words of foreign origin
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
The pall of night was growing thin,
Pardon I ask for such a sin--
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
And gossip of the town and fashion
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
In books he saw nought to condemn
And that unrivalled paragon,
The natural fickleness of passion,
A canine face with horns thereon,
The youthful poet's fond confession.
With quite a lachrymose expression
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
He enters: rapidly discussion
We all of us of education
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
And tears of reconciliation:
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
Oneguine went with trepidation
But Eugene, hating litigation
Tattiana was her appellation.
Although it will not bear translation,
A coquette loves by calculation,
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
His spirit was intent upon.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And sulked in silent indignation;
Of such a dread hallucination.
Original imagination,
Not high in general estimation;
Their Jealousy and separation
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Invigorate imagination
Of foreign whims the impersonation--
She did not think "procrastination
Triumphant by anticipation,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
In pages of a love narration
The hero is of my narration!
Alone within his habitation
By what idea or observation
For journalistic deglutition
The same unmoved oblivion
Was worthy of that old baboon,
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
As formerly much agitation.
The poet's fervid conversation
With intellect and strong volition
'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
"Why did you leave last night so soon?"
And eye which gleams with inspiration--
And buried deep in meditation,
Thy meditative incantation--
To visit Moscow in the season.
To the sarcastic observation,
His wife was also mad upon
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Was certainly no Grandison.
The works of Mr. Richardson.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?"
To write his forefathers to warn
Herself not knowing well the reason,
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He seemed for matrimony born.
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
A jolly song and distant horn;
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
Do we alone our losses mourn
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Have entered never to return.
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
Bright day will then begin to burn,
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
For summer to the country flown,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Besides, a duellist well-known
For o'er a word to fashion known,
He is not there: I am not known:
He left _you_ first, and I must own
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--
"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
Pair after pair the race sustain.
In silence shall I sit and yawn
Have one by one all withered grown
Have latterly vexatious grown;
"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
I feel thou wast by God sent down
In a half-open dressing-gown
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
You never since your nose have shown.
Impelled to union with his own
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Whither that evening he will go.
But say he was a genius who
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
I cannot understand. But lo!
And our successors soon shall drive
Not knowing its interpretation,
And marking Tania's agitation,
An innate love of meditation,
And long internal agitation
A love which knew no limitation,
Amid a serious disputation,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Quite a sensation; the position
And a determined disposition,
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Meantime Oneguine's apparition
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
The counsel good and full of reason,
And the cold beauties of the season:
Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
She was thus fond of Richardson
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Sailed silently in unison--
And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Delighted glances in return;
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Men will forget me, but my urn
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
And at the table sat her down.
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
This northern summer of our own,
She bows her head beneath the crown;(68)
And the fair sex as light as down!
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
Troy's sages should in concert own
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
And bitter torment never known.
And the young damsel from the town,
But tell me what am I to do?
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
They hand in hand to table go.
"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
"And is it she? It must be--no--
Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
And usually despised it too),
My beauty, thou art ready too.
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Pen, paper bring: the table too
"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
Inspired him with disgust and so
"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
More troublesome than usual?"--"No!
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
And so my noon hath come! If so,
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
No more remembered him; unto
For was it not her duty to
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
Together moments one or two
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Or a professor in tulle cap.
The lady in the crimson cap
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
He's a straightforward little chap."
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
And all in snow is buried deep.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
With iridescent wing doth flap
Mountains we'll level and through deep
But stares into the darkness deep.
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Long time in meditation deep
Her path across the plain doth keep--
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Or that adoring Grandison
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Lenski the foeman's apparition
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
There an imperious skeleton;
Rescue me from oblivion.
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
My very latest composition!
Beneath the silver of the moon
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
Then to some gallant in your turn
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And on the footstool sitting down
The aged nurse in ample gown,
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
The opportunity is flown.
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Thus her perversity hath shown.
slept o'er the river misty grown.
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Far from his Italy--his own.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Made me so tipsy long ago!
But would not look at Cicero.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Familiar to him long ago.
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Buried in meditation deep,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
The maids beside Tattiana keep--
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Girls in anticipation skip!
Like down from Aeolus's lip,
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
Even as the love of children dear.
Approach, approach; I am thine own."
Of roses to romancers dear;
Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
The path of hope and tender fear--
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
She will not see, she will not hear.
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
A smile from slumbering nature clear
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
There is a spot the village near
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
With one foot resting on its tip
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
The sudden rattling of a car.
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
Since in these arms I thee did bear--
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
I can't conceive a little dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Unseen thou wast already dear.
And since I pulled thee by the ear--
From everything the heart held dear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
All are constrained and fetters bear,
To be in conversation clear
With sad refrain misfortune near.
And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
Epistles of six sheets or near,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A friar black approaching near,
Mysteriously all objects near
He daily in his drives drew near
Do me a favour and appear.
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
Unknown to all he doth appear,
For which no springtime shall appear?
Doth in us or our names appear
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear"
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
But as to fighting--'twill appear!
Two dressed in uniform appear--
Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
Unhappily too salt by far;
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
For us, may be for many a year.
And exclamations and good cheer.
"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
She cannot--Eugene oped the door
With tranquil air Oneguine leads
Tania doth by the casement linger
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
His son and mortgages his lands.
And gradually day unfolds.
No one my anguish comprehends,
His hate by slander, and who spends
Unfavourable unto her.
To Eve the universal mother,
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
And courtier, fop, and usurer
What is his latest character?
Describe in detail the affair,
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
I blame not your behaviour--
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
Hope with her fascinating power
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Urging your droshkies swift as air
With purple hand Aurora leads,
His wife approaches, with him leads
And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
Around the carriage of the pair--
If they but heard domestic loads
To bring behind: the triple steeds
Anicia soon appears, the door
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
At times my reason almost bends,
Against my inclination, friends,
Existence without wife or friends,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
And care but little for its ends.
Ever to hear the same replies
His friends and also enemies
And the bad book accompanies.
And vanish like a bird in air.
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
What more's required? The world replies,
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
She from the winter corn espies
Upon those pages she descries
With raspberries, cherries.
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
From public and from private ties,
On us beyond the grave attends,
And fashion's gay frivolities;
Without grammatical mistakes.
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
His recent glory he invokes.
Never for me to reappear--
Would at the proper time appear.
So irremissible appear?
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
The shining orbs of night appear;
And happy unto you appear.
The simple epitaph--a tear
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Malek Adel and De Linar,
And that a bottle sealed with tar
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Gliding in negligent career,
As in the timid forest deer,
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
More advantageously appear
A vision desolate and drear
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
He bending whispered in her ear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
And from the Millionaya afar
And grown more curious by far
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
Amid the company career.
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
To lawless love I should prefer--
And traces with a slender finger
"The younger, you're in love with her!"
Romance of love I pray refer,
Doth love's incautiousness in her
He leisurely adorns for her.
And like a shadow haunted her.
Though superannuated rather;
Recent instructions of its mother.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Gravely repeating to another
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Aye bids ye in some way or other--
Servant of God and brigadier,
But finally grew bored by her.
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
Confront thy fated torturer!
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
Together we have wandered o'er
This was his social character.
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
I'm beaten in another matter;
Appear; along the road of Tver
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
Malicious and a slanderer.
To clank the spur, delight the fair--
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
I have dreamed many a vision fair
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
THE less we love a lady fair
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
I uttered to my lady fair
With the epistle of my fair;
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
A kerchief round her silver hair
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
And the Skatenines, aged pair,
Approaches Olga and the pair
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
At Russ she was by no means clever
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
But with confused and bashful air,
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Pray is it not a tough affair
Finally tost his arms in air
He knows Kaverine will repair.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The freshness of her heart impair,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Accents of rapture or despair
Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
Mark ye with what a modest air
'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
Flies past the porter to the stair,
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
And rising from her bench proceeds;
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
Is petted by the Emperor?--
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
Opens unto her visitor.
Impressionable for an hour,
Lest the malicious reader or
And sermon--but in that dread hour
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Pelagie Nikolavna has
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Still of his club he member was--
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Their harmless conversation blends
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
O feet, where'er your path extends
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Some one or other editor
And all that from thy hand proceeds--
"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Already dance to song proceeds;
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
She the delicious novel reads,
Are ye replaced by other maids
Tattiana to a corner, bids
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And a grand festival proceeds.
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Where each young critic ready stands,
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
I've had to make for having friends!
With love which happiness extends;
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Appear attuned to softer chords;
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
And wild among them grew her words--
With bated breath, around she bends
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
My goddesses, where are your shades?
The remnant destiny concedes,
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
That crass stupidity misleads,
Tattiana motionless abides.
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
Not the least trace Oneguine sees
Where all upon the surface lies,--
Sits down and gazes on all sides--
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Had come both friends and enemies--
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
But gray Phillippevna the door
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
In this case quite mistaken was.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
In winter, when Night longer holds
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
He now a full possession takes,
The father scarcely understands
Tattiana from the hill descends
At least their accents and their words
Who glory, wealth and dignities
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
When the same life before him lies
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
Even the rosy wafer dries
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Her head upon her breast declines
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Wherein love innocently pines.
Longer the East inert reclines
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
And fashionable magazines,
Nor beauties of far distant lands
The feet of my dear lady friends.
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
He fixedly upon her stares--
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Now, like hereditary foes,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Of passion reminiscences,
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
A crab upon a spider rides,
Of migratory gipsy hordes--
And supercilious dames she glides,
Moscow approach on bended knees,
May be that I by heaven's decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
The serpent to unlawful trees
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
And all thy precious elegies,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Around the garden homeward hies.
And overcome antipathies
The shutters open; to the skies
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
And nothing more important sees;
Look through the window and kill flies.
Tattiana to the index flies
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
The general who accompanies.
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
All breathless and without replies.
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
A sportsman who in covert lies.
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
To bear love's parching agonies--
Thrice happy who their agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
And pelt him with cherries,
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Past palaces and nunneries,
Some a mazurka occupies,
In the world's mortal revelries,
To peer into the future tries.
And alphabetically tries
My splendid house and gaieties--
The gilding of life's vanities,
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
At neighbouring hospitalities.
Spared him not their asperities.
The country hath its liberties
Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the young revellers of past times
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
The guests make room; aside each takes
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
But lights incendiary flames
To banish far unworthy themes
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Alas! he loved as in our times
I sail upon my lake at times
The fisher's fire afar illumes
The golden ember now enshrines,
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
And now he views forgotten foes,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
And meditative homeward goes,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
All arise. To the door he goes.
Between the stalls, along the toes;
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
I yield for splendid vanities,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Into the tangled garden goes
Imagination's sacred fires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
As with innumerable fires.(73)
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
All vanished as an echo goes.
And where tempestuous love's desires,
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
And due precautions take betimes.
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
The husband comes and interferes
The accents wild of other's woes,
And of the irksome harness tires,
Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.(75)
Seated, a curious look with glasses
And now his youthful heart desires
In true interpretation hates:
Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
And slowly life coagulates--
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
For tallow, wood and other things
Calmly her eyes encounter his--
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
Compassion now or wrath inspires
For rural solitude and dreams,
Latest arrivals' salutations,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Which shines with iridescent hues.
A victim decked with golden leaves;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
And what like menaces fatigues,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Our liberty at least survives:
She the acquaintances she loves,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
And various chords upon it proves,
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
Where every day before his eyes
And now she skips and now she springs
But still remembrance to him clings,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
To the pianoforte he moves
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
His travels like all other things
The frolics of maidens.
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
All that industrial London brings
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
All this in many cases brings
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
The secrets of maidens.
The silent fields no peasant nears,
Olga he sees before his eyes
Priams of country populations
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Develops and matures its powers,
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Tattiana in the young princess!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Conquer by passion and address,
Love's tender transports and distress,
And though I read it with distress,
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
(So 'twas with us in former years,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
Divinity without access
To the theatre he repairs
To loiter there in idleness
Speech was so tame and colourless
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Leaning against the dam expects,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
She visited the humble tents
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
Deliberate approach of guests
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
The time between the wolf and dogs--
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
Slow circling round its fellow swings
The old man who has had his freaks,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
Obedient to the magic strings,
And deem the world perfection is!
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
I just hint, in parenthesis,
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
To agitate me in my dreams.
His kneeling posture he retains--
Insensible her hand remains
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
And dames of fine organisations,
Old people's simple conversations
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
But now--my very blood congeals,
And beckon to the passing sails.
Which of approaching labour tells
And heedless of approval seems,
Glory with which our history teems
Descended swift in turbid streams
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Disport yourselves, maidens,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
When the sonorous Breguet tells
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
And where Thalia softly dreams
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Of conversation, thought and aims--
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
Friends and companions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
A windmill too a jig performs
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
And where the admirable streams
And lonely through the forest creeps."
In country towns, where still it keeps
Without participation hears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
With Eugene pranks of former years
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--
Old age through spectacles too peers,
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
And judgment which unsteady veers
Distracted by her grief appears
Epicurean philosophers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Of Levshin's school ye followers,(67)
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
And hated casual visitors,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
Trembling he seeks the young princess--
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Thus oft--this I myself confess--
"If the domestic hearth could bless--
And now, I mournfully confess,
Me your perfections would not bless;
Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
By bee and butterfly which pass.
The early tinkling of the bells
The two friends' compliments she hears
May yet be studious of his nails;
And the heart's agitated dreams.
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All in the good old style appears,
For visions of my childish years
Was famous for thick-headedness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And more imagination teems.
Awhile sound conversation seems
To secrets of virgins,
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
And what from its recess appears?
A little virgin mirror peeps.
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
But to Oneguine! _A propos_!
Young maidens, fair maidens,
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Although the destined coffin nears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
They were the wonderful traditions
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
I will not wed, and ever weeps
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
The solstice of our earthly years,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
Tattiana certainly infers
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
He to the festival repairs,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
A moment effervescing stirs,
And where a madrigal occurs
The manners of the highest class
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Yet satiated with success,
In the world's vortex my success,
But the indifferent princess,
There was no angling for success.
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
He _cannot_ give me happiness."
Men become friends from idleness.
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
And contemplative dreaminess;
"'Twas possible then, happiness--
"But strange am I to happiness;
Or, strange to me is happiness?
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
Their slander e'en was weariness;
Oppressive now is happiness,
Meantime in matutinal dress
Is it that human restlessness
To fawn upon and love express;
I like the difference to express
Nor discontinued to distress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Tattiana's letter I possess,
But Eugene long hath left the press
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
The uncontaminated kiss
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
If wife and children to possess
This evanescent boyish bliss.
If the raw product they possess
Past darkened windows and long streets
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
The maiden at her casement sits
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
A rivulet beneath them shoots
All that the heart would fain express--
In old age life is weariness!"
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
Where my days in the wilderness
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
To array himself in evening dress.
Or kiss the border of her dress.
With spiritual tenderness;
A young Armida's lips to press,
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
This gentle daring who could guess?
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Inflict annoyance and distress
Though without palaces and streets,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The hours once more Oneguine counts,
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The stomach doth admonish us.
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Their coming which no man expects,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
A million bipeds reckons thus
A slave of actresses capricious,
There Didelot became glorious,
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Amid sly, pusillanimous
The Paris of those country parts
The drive becomes monotonous--
Then ye were barely generous,
The friend of liberty and laws
And through the lofty windows views
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Before a fire which feebly glows
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
The connoisseur his glances throws
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The first appearance of the snows
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
We called to mind our youthful days--
That vanished are my youthful days
But even thus not now-a-days!
But soon she altered all her ways,
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
Or parody of modern ways?
A hundred times will not repeat,
Alone amid possessions great,
Till out of breath upon a seat
The disenchanted glass direct
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
The household troop of little boys,
It will be by a mob beset
Of every sort and every set!"
Nor interest in aught betrays.
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
The perfidies I recollect
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Two verses he could recollect
The glass unwittingly inspect
Are oft deceptive--like their feet.
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
Near Khariton's in a side street
The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
Then in the silent cabinet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The fair, nor parted with regret,
For twice you came to them and yet
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
"Then amongst strangers I was left--
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
All about Olga--to a light
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
A sense of social delight,
And like the prisoner's our delight
As a babe's slumber, or the light
The crowd and merriment and light,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
That heart with inspiration sweet
Variety of speech and vests,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
Ever receive with kindly hearts
By such allusions scandalous,
His watch, the sun in turn he views--
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
The conversation tedious
She seemed of him oblivious,
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Thou also, reader generous,
It was a cheery, generous
Well! Larina appears to us
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
On unknown female forms he throws.
How mean, how pusillanimous!
To male acquaintances he bows,
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
The men salute with lower bows
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And I confess that now-a-days
To vary for a few brief days.
For otherwise--God only knows!
In one of thine enchanting lays
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Upon the dreary northern snows,
The very morning of our days.
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Unto Anicia for the keys
Oneguine his excuses says;
A joyous troop of little boys
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
Through dense aristocratic rows
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Companion of my childhood's days.
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
No more with pale Diana's rays,
I mean my name not to repeat."
And at economy was great;
And cry: he was a poet great!
Now all things round about repeat
On this artistical retreat
Removed her to his country seat,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
"No misery I see in that"--
Upon my lake I love to float,
And blush to own himself reflect.
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
Abandoned he his country seat,
Approach not to gaze at
An inn at every stage erect.
But now--what brings you to my feet?--
Faithfully shall I now depict,
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
And by that shady rivulet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
But from the Muses' loftiest height
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Raises within my breast as oft
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
To find in gossip such delight,
Contemplativeness, her delight,
I love its furious delight,
By liberties or loose or light.
I might to connoisseurs repeat
The firmament in mellow light,
If in the scenes of home I might
Was younger than myself, my light,
Time was, a valiant general might
And blest the shadows of the night.
The altar flame was quenched in night.
My morning birdie, yesternight
But time flies and she doth forget
Should make me much more circumspect,
So full of piety, correct,
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
The miserable bard to meet,
Ah! I still struggle to forget
So prudent, and so circumspect
Our paradise is no more sweet.
My friends, the poet ye regret!
China and bronze the tables weight,
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
And with emotional delight
And Christian folk will, I expect,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
And by the world repeated oft,
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
A simple tombstone hath been set.
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
In my young days of wild delight
They will receive us with delight."
And bless mankind with full delight.
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
In such an album with delight
My pen no longer finds delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Was withered ere the morning light--
There came a sudden flash of light,
Arising with the morning's light,
That the two friends with morning's light
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
And showed with an uncertain light
And be as happy--as I might.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
His care unto his pistols' plight,
Lay languishing both day and night--
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And full of innocent delight,
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
The china teapot too ye might
Outside descend the mists of night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
That glimmered through the radiant night
"Delighted."--"When?"--"This very night.
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
And better, if I judge aright;
His ditties were as pure and bright
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
And form a network left and right;
If they were similar in aught.
I am not worthy them in aught;
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
A register of fleeting thought,
An ever transcendental flight;
The motley moving mass and bright,
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright--
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
And never was the ear affright
In the first place, say, am I right?
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
As on the rapid wings of thought
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
A table to the fire is brought,
At first such contradictions wrought
My memory wandered wide and sought
Immersed in melancholy thought,
The early days of life we sought.
The moon, the stars, and shining night--
The "in memoriam" pages sought,
Though by an error and unsought--
But now ridiculous a bit.
All Nature winter seemed to await,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Must take a walk and rest a bit--
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
The table with its lamp unlit,
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
The master always used to sit.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
On fresh allurements they are bent,
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
A letter for her hero meant:
In the unmoved, magnificent
That Heaven her character had blent
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
The limits of enlightenment
The languid mind could smile at nought,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The snow upon the streets doth melt--
Allure the young gallant
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
And o'er the granite coping bent,
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Shines in the female firmament
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
Awakens secret merriment
But now--none heeds the monument
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Two minutes they in silence spent,
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Their heroes used to represent
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
And with his lot in life content,
In course of time (the whole extent
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
But was our friend Eugene content,
And scanned in silence its content.
First reconciled and then content;
So Tania to her heart's content
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Time was, in style magniloquent
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Not so! My Moscow never went
Since leisure was together spent,
And all the three to breakfast went;
The Larinas unwisely went,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
An invalid from lung complaint.
Oneguine to the window went
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Inseparable from our lot;
Ourselves as unities to count;
Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
To Russ indigenous are not;
One moment's slumber suffer not.
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
The poor girl fell into a faint,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Into the district then to boot
In spite of common sense we're wont
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Into the chamber where he slept
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
By neighbouring families bewept,
But the young unpolluted heart
Just before dinner-time he slept,
And ease the tortures of the heart--
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
A maiden's secrets--of the heart.
A lancer captivates her heart!
A hidden meaning could impart,
That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"
His own antagonists expert,
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Now talkative, now reticent;
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
The fires of passion and its smart--
Then touching Olga they depart
Their voices nought to her impart
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
Like a Bacchante in her sport
For every loyal Russian breast!
The gulf between them was so vast,
A new world was made manifest!
But Fortune cast our lots apart
By flattery and lover's art--
There is no fishmarket retort
And, by the way, I here assert
Vociferously paid her court,
An infant maiden doth exhort
The laws of generations past,
But this is my advice, 'twere best
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest;
(This joking I used to protest),
In Russ her love made manifest,
Their idols they were wont to invest
Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
Like you and me and all the rest?--
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
By fond illusions once possest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Now with what eager interest
But first permission did request
Am I to go through the whole list?"
Unto the sounding sea to list,
His weary head declined at rest,
So many neighbours here exist--
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
That every morn at Verrey's cost
By their own horses, not the post--
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
To what malicious merriment,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
All the young people round about,
But you must both be quite tired out!
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
At forty suffered from the gout,
Their claims and explanations shout.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
To light had brought them from their dust,
"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
But with austerity!--for you
"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you(70)
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholy's claw
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
I have known beauties cold and raw
On lines invisible are fixt;
Because he yawned at the bare view
The unaffected traits she now
Then they came easily enow,
The God of Love is after you!
A young man motionless he saw,
Russia's Terpsichore review
But upon all that Eugene knew
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
My little book. With thee I knew
The triumph of a conquest new.
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
And soon imagination threw
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And by degrees upon him grew
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
But such is not my project now,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.(69)
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Unto their solitude one day,
As men who much had done that day.
Chained to his bedside night and day
And in reality one day
And all your love on self bestow;
In this the love of the fair sex
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
That he was "ready any day."
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
We glide along a floor of wax.
Then, her distraction to allay,
Some army poet therein may
And though perchance a lady may
The woods, still naked to the view,
"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
Beside the stormy sea one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
In the beginning of this lay,
And for a time our course delay,
Time was, his raillery was gay,
"Bring dinner now without delay!"
The bridegroom sage without delay
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
And wholly occupied his day--
That grandmothers and grandsires may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Minutely I will now portray.
But I abandoned their array,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say--
I by the button-hole seize fast
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
(Though certainly mankind he knew
As in a garden when I grew,
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
To look on life as on a show,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
They sat, but conversation's flow
Till January fell no snow--
Maids in the corner whisper low;
In love, although its tempests vex,
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Nought but of dinners a long row,
And also fashionable beaux.
To anticipate the break of day,
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
In haunts of fashion where each day
Well! just as she was yesterday.
She was as heedless and as gay--
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
Arrange without the least delay--
No senseless fashionable lay
For the young poet they display.
Another visit hastes to pay.
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
So frequently his mind would stray
Unto her husband, went away--
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
To make wise men the idiot play
'Tis there that arrant fops display
Carried a truth divine away;
The mystic lines to tear away
Impetuously clove its way
In a lax or informal way,
A lover's letter might convey,
But Eugene, incontestably,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
But not at present, though sincerely
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Lo! through the frozen windows play
His intellect in close array.
In cruel solitude each day
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
The starry beacons fade away,
Horror! had she not better stay
And gallops to her house away.
But thoughts meander far away--
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
His furs are powdered on the way
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
Ah! he has gone the other way"--
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Tania, observed by nobody,
At table she was sitting by
And (elbows on the table) they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey;
May find a crumb to satisfy.
The witching light of sympathy;
The nights of golden Italy
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
"No matter, look immediately.
The lily's stem to eat away,
Took aim--but as immediately
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Unto the gates the servants fly
I like this word exceedingly
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
And the world met her smilingly,
Terror assails her. Hastily
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
So from the mountain lazily
To all she answers cruelly--
Near young Tattiana resident,
Calm and without embarrassment,
'Tis time she to the altar went!
A while ago the winter spent,
To a surrender gave consent,
And consolation soon begot.
My country and an exile's lot;
Anew the flames of passion start
"Long since I held thee at the font--
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Examine her from head to foot.
Just manages a feeble trot
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Eugene designed with me to start
Vanished his youthful years at last,
A flimsy trace of musings past
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
Was a delightful little spot,
The indignation of her heart!
May well in innocence impart.
How well he played the greenhorn's part
How soon he learnt deception's art,
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,(85)
"I weep. And if within your breast
The fatal hour had come at last--
'Twas she who first within his breast
No sense was ever manifest
Is once again made manifest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
The credulous indeed are blest,
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest--
And then made merry pope and guest,
Their own productions, some insist
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Romances pleased her from the first,
Can we not stealthily make out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
And where may be her sister now?
The fire extinguished in his breast,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
Obedient then to Nature's law,
To the young girl he said adieu,
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
Villages in the distance show
The wind rose instantly, blew out
How full of fire his speech would glow!
To the youth Eugene hurried now--
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
They are all natural and low,
All the creations which below
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
To-morrow before break of day,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
Till morn--life uniform but gay,
How sick to death his uncle lay
Unto a carping world must show--
Listless is she the livelong day
How with thy medal I would play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
"How often in thine arms I lay;
Unto the hero of this lay
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay--
Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
To see his Olga ere the fray--
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
The trees in silvery array,
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
All with urbanity betray,
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.
How oft the kindly Muse away
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
Lost in the hamlet far away.
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Unto the fields she makes her way,
To consanguineous dinners they
Or innocently past me fly.
I cannot tell the reason why,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
Eventually petrify
The evanescent fashions fly
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Descried before me suddenly!
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Or into bold hands anxiously
Known unto children perfectly:
Though I'll return to him right early,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
"Then send your grandson quietly
To lay two covers secretly.
In the French language perfectly,
Then he'd malign them secretly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
The artifice of villany--
Turned to her and discordantly
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The same warm vision constantly;
But who in that choice company
The man and liked his company,
There, in that knot of company,
Then be it so! My destiny
There is no stupid calumny
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
I thank thee. In thy company,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Whose hands indulgently caress
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her agitation and distress
Habit was given us in distress
A strong resemblance these possess--
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Wherefore regarding him express
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fuss--
As every journal now entreats,
Whom latterly one often meets
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
With cherries, red currants,
Even amusing fools we miss
Beside the thundering abyss
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
We Russians, friends from distant parts
Whereto in language courteous
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
Yea! although rendered beauteous
A critic of the stage malicious,
With satisfaction marvellous,
Come sing we in chorus
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
But, after mutual compliments,
And like Napoleons each of us
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Abandon cities riotous,
Perverse, unfavourable views?
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
Who labours hard to humour us?
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The epitaph on marble shows:
With all dissatisfaction shows.
And this the faithful one allows,
When Passion's fire no longer glows
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
Of fiery youth's untutored days
And stay whose length none recollects.
As partner of my mournful days,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
As the sins of my youthful days
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
And then to meditate for days
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
When he in ardent verse portrays
Delighted much his former ways
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
When in the study's calm retreat,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
And hates the world's discordant ways.
Of the Aeneid, but incorrect.
Born of a babbler in a loft
E'en for an instant find delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Age immature averse to cheat--
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
"But death from him will be delight.
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
Full many a lovely star hath night
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
When I yon semicircle bright
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
And glasses unemployed all night;
I was half silly with affright.
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
And in a whisper did repeat:
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
A ball here, there a children's treat,
But when two minutes she had sat,
Her brow she did not e'en contract
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
With so much warmth and intellect?
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
Begins to talk of this and that,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Where I can no more recollect?--
Herein my portrait should detect,
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
Where fashionable circles meet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
Wherein I castigation get;
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
When in her walks abroad she met
Without enthusiasm he met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Of one thing till again we met.
Ere the bright messenger had set.
And we--an unattractive set--
On whom a sister's heart was set
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
Of consolation all bereft--
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
"I with my friend intend to fight!"
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
And solitude and calm delight,
Resounding through all ages might
From her half-open vest of night.
Paris and Menelaus right.
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Because in singleness of thought
Eugene of course related nought,
She hears of conversation nought
With epigrams impertinent,
Because she was so innocent,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Who cannot conjure former joys?
And hurried home his awful freight.
Above the yawning grave would fight,--
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
He finally lost all delight
His ardent soul with full delight.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Or but for fame he saw the light;
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
But lo! already the moon's light
Yet clearer shines than every light
On guests their servants used to wait
Abandoning insane delight,
So there will be a dance to-night.
Oneguine could not now submit,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
Adorned with many a vision bright
His butting horns in anger bent,
Like a full moon magnificent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
With scandal's trivial ornament.
The curse of commonplace delight.
Behold! the moon was shining bright
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
And my dark soul to light was brought;
Seductive, animated, bright,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Full of exasperating thought.
From storms protection having sought,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
With measured step and even gait
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
E'en as the poet says he leant.
Of affectation innocent,
Who would the maiden innocent
Bringing his partner corpulent
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
He somewhat blushing would omit:
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Or torturer malevolent?
A timid love to banishment?--
Having this mournful document
Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Haughty appear, subservient,
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
A forest now she sees in front
Now it is ready to be sent--
What once I knew is clean forgot--
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
Just at this moment I cannot.
Because her passion wanted art,
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Rekindled in my withered heart
And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
Philanthropist or patriot,
Thee but a little space bewept,
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Confessions which a trusting heart
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
And the lone secret of her heart,
Poetic transport. They impart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
And is it true her garland bright
Terror of guardians of the night;
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
With pungent or obtuse retort,
As if it were some funeral feast.
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
She found herself alone at last,
Having once fixed your interest,
And so--God bless them, if He list.
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
She led me through nocturnal mist
A beauty languidly at rest,
With this immoderate request
Whither departed is the host?
As yet none had discovered aught;
But trusted the ideal she wrought?--
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Of harmony enshrining thought.
To accompany him and to escort
A box of terrible import.
When the obedient doll in sport
Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
She hid the trouble of her breast,
At times to silence would resort,
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
And grant his weary bones their rest
Ye feel but little interest,
From apprehension of the cost,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
The body they consigned to rest,
With what avidity and zest
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
She buries deep within her breast
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Of creditors a hungry rout
And in the final tome we learnt,
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
Who words and actions will adjust
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,--
See, I can hardly crawl about--
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Demands that I translate for you
But praised be God! in health art thou!
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
She never more his face may view,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
To end with him her path below.
He back as from a sudden blow?--
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Gazing upon a note below.
With its exhilarating flow,
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
From happy inspiration flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Whose countless golden crosses glow
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Society he duped enow."
A feeble version read below,
Its insignificance I know
And in the morning doth not know
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Which falls in starry flakes below.
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
No obstacle of which I know.
And linen on him doth bestow.
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
And past the threshold of decay,
And is it true and not a jest,
Again her rural life she sought,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
"You have a letter to me sent.
As we lure the young gallant,
No answer! He another sent.
Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Obsequious or indifferent!
And meditative from the spot
Within her; she is sick at heart;
And no ridiculous report,
He was beloved: or say at least,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
From shades of the relentless past.
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Within resounded shriek and shout:
The bee forth from his cell of wax
What languor would his silence show,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Jilted--glad of a holiday.
What, invitations? The same day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Yet on a frosty winter day
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
From Romulus unto our day.
Olga's admirer came that day:
We visit about Christmas Day,
Had much to do at home that day,
He offers her his murderous paw;
She gazed around her--it was day.
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Within his memory there lay,
Fair object of my guileless lay,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Corneille's majestic genius,
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Cunning already to display
Let us congratulations pay
Curtly announcing for the fray
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
Behind, of glasses an array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
Which rushed in eager dense array
And well-instructed to betray!
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
He cared no longer there to stay,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Oneguine Olga bore away.
Who, heard the music of my lay,
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--
Nor doth my absent pen portray
But it grew late; he must not stay;
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Here bottles stand in close array,
As it were, tore himself away.
I write, and anguish flies away,
Without a chance to slip away.
And to Oneguine far away
But borne in spirit far away
From the dread pistol turn away.
With serious air then went away
It whiled his idle hours away
He still made love in a queer way;
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
No trace ye left in passing by
He would not that a man ye slay
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Oneguine sat the table by
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Possess my love and sympathy.
At least by show of sympathy;
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
When on the pallid eastern sky
She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
Upon his couch insensibly;
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
With clouded brow stands silently?
Presents her quarto amiably,
Around her neck, now violently
And of the attic. Honestly,
And like a palisade flit by.(72)
And turned to leave immediately,
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
"Who will be there?"--"The family.
What say you? to the family--
I would not part with finally;
Or other mask donned playfully?
God save his soul eternally
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And the far mountains daintily
Have my Oneguine--suddenly.
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
You'll spend your winter famously!
"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
What agitation languidly
With him were friends eternally:
But of this love, e'en casually,
She cannot--then impatiently
"And he--but of him presently--
Employ your glasses constantly,
Having performed his service truly,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
She loved upon the balcony
He brought from mystic Germany
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
He drops his pistol silently.
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Must now my stanzas occupy.
The captain of a company.
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
The happiest days of life employ?
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The feeble moment would espy
Which in the winter were a joy:
And following them ye might espy
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
She strains her throat to force a cry--
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
The clue unto some mystery
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
Upon the windows tracery,
And turned aside the drapery;
To be a charming mystery:
Alike by sighs and flattery.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
With ardent sighs and flattery
Fragments of northern poetry,
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
By night prepared for sorcery,
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
That Nina's marble symmetry,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
And platitudes and pedantry,
Byron's capricious phantasy
Must bow in common courtesy;
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
By the sick lady's gaiety
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Carried away by ecstasy,
But man of sense and probity.
Charming with grave simplicity.
With jealous fear, anxiety.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity;
Upon its damp opacity,
Cursing his own stupidity,
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
And then with blind credulity
Relate some ancient history."
And husbands' tedious amity?
The blessings of humanity.
I will with thy divinity
And naked uniformity.
Hears not my importunity!
But grant with magnanimity
By his embarrassed dignity--
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Charming is your sincerity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Like him renouncing vanity,
As Winter in their purity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With us 'tis quite a novelty
Of old maids the divinity,
As giddy youth's hilarity--
With hope and then perplexity,
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Idolatry of liberty,
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
I thought--retirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
